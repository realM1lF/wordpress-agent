# Block Editor Handbook

## In this article

Welcome to the Block Editor Handbook.

The [**Block Editor**](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) is a modern paradigm for
WordPress site building and publishing. It uses a modular system of **blocks** to
compose and format content and is designed to create rich and flexible layouts for
websites and digital products.

The Block Editor consists of several primary elements, as shown in the following
figure:

![Quick view of the Block Editor](https://i0.wp.com/raw.githubusercontent.com/WordPress/
gutenberg/trunk/docs/assets/overview-block-editor-2023.png?ssl=1)

The elements highlighted are:

 1. **Inserter:** A panel for inserting blocks into the content canvas
 2. **Content canvas:** The content editor, which holds content created with blocks
 3. **Settings Panel:** A panel for configuring a block’s settings when selected or
    the settings of the post

Through the Block Editor, you create content modularly using blocks. Many [blocks](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/core-blocks/)
are available in WordPress by default, and you can also [create your own](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/create-block/).

A [block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts/#blocks)
is a discrete element such as a Paragraph, Heading, Media, or Embed. Each block 
is treated as a separate element with individual editing and format controls. When
all these components are pieced together, they make up the content of the page or
post, which is then [stored in the WordPress database](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/data-flow/#serialization-and-parsing).

The Block Editor is the result of the work done on the [**Gutenberg project**](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/#what-is-gutenberg),
which aims to revolutionize the WordPress editing experience.

Besides offering an [enhanced editing experience](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/)
through visual content creation tools, the Block Editor is also a powerful developer
platform with a [rich feature set of APIs](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/)
that allow it to be manipulated and extended in countless ways.

## 󠀁[Navigating this handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/?output_format=md#navigating-this-handbook)󠁿

This handbook is focused on block development and is divided into five major sections.

 * **[Getting Started](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/):**
   For those just starting out with block development, this is where you can get
   set up with a [development environment](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/)
   and learn the [fundamentals of block development](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/fundamentals/).
   Its [Quick Start Guide](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/quick-start-guide/)
   and [Tutorial: Build your first block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/tutorial/)
   are great places to start learning block development.
 * **[How-to Guides](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/):**
   Here, you can build on what you learned in the Getting Started section and learn
   how to solve particular problems. You will also find tutorials and example code
   to reuse in your own projects, such as [working with WordPress data](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/data-basics/)
   or [Curating the Editor Experience](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/curating-the-editor-experience/).
 * **[Reference Guides](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/):**
   This section is the heart of the handbook and is where you can get down to the
   nitty-gritty and look up the details of the particular API you’re working with
   or need information on. Among other things, the [Block API Reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/)
   covers most of what you will want to do with a block, and each [component](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/components/)
   and [package](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/)
   is also documented here. _Components are also documented via [Storybook](https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/?path=/story/docs-introduction--page)._
 * **[Explanations](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/):**
   This section enables you to go deeper and reinforce your practical knowledge 
   with a theoretical understanding of the [Architecture](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/)
   of the Block Editor.
 * **[Contributor Guide](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/):**
   Gutenberg is open-source software, and everyone is welcome to contribute to the
   project. This section details how to contribute, whether with [code](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/code/),
   [design](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/design/), 
   [documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/documentation/),
   or in some other way.

## 󠀁[Further resources](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/?output_format=md#further-resources)󠁿

This handbook should be considered the canonical resource for all things related
to block development. However, there are other resources that can help you.

 * **[WordPress Developer Blog](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/):** An ever-
   growing resource of technical articles covering specific topics related to block
   development and a wide variety of use cases. The blog is also an excellent way
   to [keep up with the latest developments in WordPress](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/tag/roundup/).
 * **[Learn WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/):** The WordPress hub for learning
   resources where you can find courses like [Introduction to Block Development: Build your first custom block](https://learn.wordpress.org/course/introduction-to-block-development-build-your-first-custom-block/),

   or [Using the WordPress Data Layer](https://learn.wordpress.org/course/using-the-wordpress-data-layer/)
 * **[WordPress.tv](https://wordpress.tv/):** A hub of WordPress-related videos (
   from talks at WordCamps to recordings of online workshops) curated and moderated
   by the WordPress community. You’re sure to find something to aid your learning
   about [block development](https://wordpress.tv/?s=block%20development&sort=newest)
   or the [Block Editor](https://wordpress.tv/?s=block%20editor&sort=relevance) 
   here.
 * **[Gutenberg repository](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/):** Development
   of the Block Editor takes place on GitHub. The repository contains the code of
   interesting packages such as [`block-library`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/block-library/src)(
   core blocks) or [`components`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/components)(
   common UI elements). _The [block-development-examples](https://github.com/WordPress/block-development-examples)
   repository is another useful reference._
 * **[End User Documentation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/):** This documentation
   site is targeted to the end user (not developers), where you can also find documentation
   about the [Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/category/block-editor/)
   and [working with blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/work-with-blocks/).

# Block Development Environment

## In this article

 * [Code editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/?output_format=md#code-editor)
 * [Node.js development tools](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/?output_format=md#node-js-development-tools)
 * [Local WordPress environment](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/?output_format=md#local-wordpress-environment)


This guide will help you set up the right development environment to create blocks
and other plugins that extend and modify the Block Editor in WordPress.

A block development environment includes the tools you need on your computer to 
successfully develop for the Block Editor. The three essential requirements are:

 * [Block Development Environment](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/?output_format=md#block-development-environment)
    - [Code editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/?output_format=md#code-editor)
    - [Node.js development tools](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/?output_format=md#nodejs-development-tools)
    - [Local WordPress environment](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/?output_format=md#local-wordpress-environment)

 To contribute to the Gutenberg project itself, refer to the additional documentation
in the [code contribution guide](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/code/getting-started-with-code-contribution).

## 󠀁[Code editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/?output_format=md#code-editor)󠁿

A code editor is used to write code. You can use whichever editor you’re most comfortable
with. The key is having a way to open, edit, and save text files.

If you do not already have a preferred code editor, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)(
VS Code) is a popular choice for JavaScript development among Core contributors.
It works well across the three major platforms (Windows, Linux, and Mac), is open-
source, and is actively maintained by Microsoft. VS Code also has a vibrant community
providing plugins and extensions, including many for WordPress development.

## 󠀁[Node.js development tools](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/?output_format=md#node-js-development-tools)󠁿

Node.js (`node`) is an open-source runtime environment that allows you to execute
JavaScript outside of the web browser. While Node.js is not required for all WordPress
JavaScript development, it’s essential when working with modern JavaScript tools
and developing for the Block Editor.

Node.js and its accompanying development tools allow you to:

 * Install and run WordPress packages needed for Block Editor development, such 
   as `wp-scripts`
 * Set up local WordPress environments with `wp-env` and `@wp-playground/cli`
 * Use the latest ECMAScript features and write code in ESNext
 * Lint, format, and test JavaScript code
 * Scaffold custom blocks with the `create-block` package

The list goes on. While modern JavaScript development can be challenging, WordPress
provides several tools, like [`wp-scripts`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-scripts/)
and [`create-block`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-create-block/),
that streamline the process and are made possible by Node.js development tools.

**The recommended Node.js version for block development is [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)(
Long Term Support)**. However, there are times when you need to use different versions.
A Node.js version manager tool like `nvm` is strongly recommended and allows you
to change your `node` version when required. You will also need Node Package Manager(`
npm`) and the Node Package eXecute (`npx`) to work with some WordPress packages.
Both are installed automatically with Node.js.

To be able to use the Node.js tools and [packages provided by WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages)
for block development, you’ll need to set a proper Node.js runtime environment on
your machine. To learn more about how to do this, refer to the links below.

 * [Install Node.js for Mac and Linux](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/nodejs-development-environment/#node-js-installation-on-mac-and-linux-with-nvm)
 * [Install Node.js for Windows](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/nodejs-development-environment/#node-js-installation-on-windows-and-others)

## 󠀁[Local WordPress environment](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/?output_format=md#local-wordpress-environment)󠁿

A local WordPress environment (site) provides a controlled, efficient, and secure
space for development, allowing you to build and test your code before deploying
it to a production site. The same [requirements](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/about/requirements/)
for WordPress apply to local sites.

In the broader WordPress community, many tools are available for setting up a local
WordPress environment on your computer. The Block Editor Handbook covers `wp-env`,
which is open-source and maintained by the WordPress project itself. It’s also the
recommended tool for Gutenberg development.

Refer to the [Get started with `wp-env`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-env/)
guide for setup instructions.

 Throughout the Handbook, you may also see references to `[@wp-playground/cli](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/tree/trunk/packages/playground/cli)`.
This is a lightweight tool powered by [WordPress Playground](https://developer.wordpress.org/playground/)
that streamlines setting up a simple local WordPress environment. While still experimental,
this tool is great for quickly testing WordPress releases, plugins, and themes.

This list is not exhaustive, but here are several additional options to choose from
if you prefer not to use `wp-env`:

 * [WordPress Studio](https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/)
 * [Local](https://localwp.com/)
 * [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)
 * [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/mac/)
 * [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/) (VVV)

# Quick Start Guide

## In this article

 * [Scaffold the block plugin](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/quick-start-guide/?output_format=md#scaffold-the-block-plugin)
 * [Basic usage](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/quick-start-guide/?output_format=md#basic-usage)
 * [View the block in action](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/quick-start-guide/?output_format=md#view-the-block-in-action)
 * [Additional resources](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/quick-start-guide/?output_format=md#additional-resources)


This guide is designed to demonstrate the basic principles of block development 
in WordPress using a hands-on approach. Following the steps below, you will create
a custom block plugin that uses modern JavaScript (ESNext and JSX) in a matter of
minutes. The example block displays the copyright symbol (©) and the current year,
the perfect addition to any website’s footer. You can see these steps in action 
through this short video demonstration.

## 󠀁[Scaffold the block plugin](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/quick-start-guide/?output_format=md#scaffold-the-block-plugin)󠁿

Start by ensuring you have Node.js and `npm` installed on your computer. Review 
the [Node.js development environment](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/nodejs-development-environment/)
guide if not.

Next, use the [`@wordpress/create-block`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/)
package and the [`@wordpress/create-block-tutorial-template`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block-tutorial-template/)
template to scaffold the complete “Copyright Date Block” plugin.

 You can use `create-block` to scaffold a block just about anywhere and then use
[`wp-env`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-env/)
inside the generated plugin folder. This will create a local WordPress development
environment with your new block plugin installed and activated.
 If you already 
have your own [local WordPress development environment](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/#local-wordpress-environment),
navigate to the `plugins/` folder using the terminal.

Choose the folder where you want to create the plugin, and then execute the following
command in the terminal from within that folder:

    ```language-sh
    npx @wordpress/create-block copyright-date-block --template @wordpress/create-block-tutorial-template
    ```

The `slug` provided (`copyright-date-block`) defines the folder name for the scaffolded
plugin and the internal block name.

Navigate to the Plugins page of your local WordPress installation and activate the“
Copyright Date Block” plugin. The example block will then be available in the Editor.

## 󠀁[Basic usage](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/quick-start-guide/?output_format=md#basic-usage)󠁿

With the plugin activated, you can explore how the block works. Use the following
command to move into the newly created plugin folder and start the development process.

    ```language-sh
    cd copyright-date-block && npm start
    ```

When `create-block` scaffolds the block, it installs `wp-scripts` and adds the most
common scripts to the block’s `package.json` file. Refer to the [Get started with wp-scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-scripts/)
article for an introduction to this package.

The `npm start` command will start a development server and watch for changes in
the block’s code, rebuilding the block whenever modifications are made.

When you are finished making changes, run the `npm run build` command. This optimizes
the block code and makes it production-ready.

## 󠀁[View the block in action](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/quick-start-guide/?output_format=md#view-the-block-in-action)󠁿

You can use any local WordPress development environment to test your new block, 
but the scaffolded plugin includes configuration for `wp-env`. You must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
already installed and running on your machine, but if you do, run the `npx wp-env
start` command.

Once the script finishes running, you can access the local environment at: `http://
localhost:8888`. Log into the WordPress dashboard using username `admin` and password`
password`. The plugin will already be installed and activated. Open the Editor or
Site Editor, and insert the Copyright Date Block as you would any other block.

Visit the [Getting started](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-env/)
guide to learn more about `wp-env`.

What follows is a set of questions that have come up from the last few years of 
Gutenberg development. If you have any questions you’d like to have answered and
included here, [just open up a GitHub issue](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues)
with your question. We’d love the chance to answer and provide clarity to questions
we might not have thought to answer. For a look back historically, please see Matt’s
November 2018 post [WordPress 5.0: A Gutenberg FAQ](https://ma.tt/2018/11/a-gutenberg-faq/).

## 󠀁[The Gutenberg Project](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#the-gutenberg-project)󠁿

### 󠀁[What is Gutenberg?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#what-is-gutenberg)󠁿

“Gutenberg” is the name of the project to create a new editor experience for WordPress—
contributors have been working on it since January 2017 and it’s one of the most
significant changes to WordPress in years. It’s built on the idea of using “blocks”
to write and design posts and pages. This will serve as the foundation for future
improvements to WordPress, including blocks as a way not just to design posts and
pages, but also entire sites. The overall goal is to simplify the first-time user
experience of WordPress — for those who are writing, editing, publishing, and designing
web pages. The editing experience is intended to give users a better visual representation
of what their post or page will look like when they hit publish. Originally, this
was the kickoff goal:

>  The editor will endeavor to create a new page and post building experience that
> makes writing rich posts effortless, and has “blocks” to make it easy what today
> might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or “mystery meat” embed discovery.

Key takeaways include the following points:

 * Authoring richly laid-out posts is a key strength of WordPress.
 * By embracing blocks as an interaction paradigm, we can unify multiple different
   interfaces into one. Instead of learning how to write shortcodes and custom HTML,
   or pasting URLs to embed media, there’s a common, reliable flow for inserting
   any kind of content.
 * “Mystery meat” refers to hidden features in software, features that you have 
   to discover. WordPress already supports a large number of blocks and 30+ embeds,
   so let’s surface them.

Gutenberg is developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg) under
the WordPress organization. The block editor has been available in core WordPress
since 5.0. If you want to test upcoming features from Gutenberg project, it is [available in the plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/).

### 󠀁[What’s on the roadmap long term?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#whats-on-the-roadmap-long-term)󠁿

There are four phases of Gutenberg which you can see on the [official WordPress roadmap](https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/).
As of writing this, we’re currently in phase 2:

 1. Easier Editing — Already available in WordPress since 5.0, with ongoing improvements.
 2. Customization — Full Site editing, Block Patterns, Block Directory, Block based
    themes.
 3. Collaboration — A more intuitive way to co-author content
 4. Multi-lingual — Core implementation for Multi-lingual sites

### 󠀁[When was Gutenberg started?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#when-was-gutenberg-started)󠁿

The editor focus started in early 2017 with the first three months spent designing,
planning, prototyping, and testing prototypes, to help us inform how to approach
this project. The first plugin was launched during WordCamp Europe in June 2017.

### 󠀁[When was Gutenberg merged into WordPress?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#when-was-gutenberg-merged-into-wordpress)󠁿

Gutenberg was first merged into [WordPress 5.0](https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/)
in December 2018. See [the versions in WordPress page](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/principles/versions-in-wordpress/)
for a complete list of Gutenberg plugin versions merged into WordPress core releases.

### 󠀁[WordPress is already the world’s most popular publishing platform. Why change the editor at all?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#wordpress-is-already-the-worlds-most-popular-publishing-platform-why-change-the-editor-at-all)󠁿

The Editor is where most of the action happens in WordPress’s daily use, and it 
was a place where we could polish and perfect the block experience in a contained
environment. Further, as an open-source project, we believe that it is critical 
for WordPress to continue to innovate and keep working to make the core experience
intuitive and enjoyable for all users. As a community project, Gutenberg has the
potential to do just that, and we’re excited to pursue this goal together. If you’d
like to test, contribute, or offer feedback, we welcome you to [share what you find on GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues).

## 󠀁[The Editing Experience](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#the-editing-experience)󠁿

### 󠀁[What are “blocks” and why are we using them?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#what-are-blocks-and-why-are-we-using-them)󠁿

The classic WordPress editor is an open text window—it’s always been a wonderful
blank canvas for writing, but when it comes to building posts and pages with images,
multimedia, embedded content from social media, polls, and other elements, it required
a mix of different approaches that were not always intuitive:

 * Media library/HTML for images, multimedia and approved files.
 * Pasted links for embeds.
 * Shortcodes for specialized assets from plugins.
 * Featured images for the image at the top of a post or page.
 * Excerpts for subheadings.
 * Widgets for content on the side of a page.

As we thought about these uses and how to make them obvious and consistent, we began
to embrace the concept of “blocks.” All of the above items could be blocks: easy
to search and understand, and easy to dynamically shift around the page. The block
concept is very powerful, and when designed thoughtfully, can offer an outstanding
editing and publishing experience. Ultimately, the idea with blocks is to create
a new common language across WordPress, a new way to connect users to plugins, and
replace a number of older content types — things like shortcodes and widgets — that
one usually has to be well-versed in the idiosyncrasies of WordPress to understand.

### 󠀁[What is the writing experience like?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#what-is-the-writing-experience-like)󠁿

Our goal with Gutenberg is not just to create a seamless post- and page-building
experience. We also want to ensure that it provides a seamless writing experience.
To test this out yourself, [head to this demo and give it a try](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/)!

### 󠀁[Is Gutenberg built on top of TinyMCE?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#is-gutenberg-built-on-top-of-tinymce)󠁿

No. [TinyMCE](https://www.tinymce.com/) is only used for the “Classic” block.

### 󠀁[Are there Keyboard Shortcuts for Gutenberg?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#are-there-keyboard-shortcuts-for-gutenberg)󠁿

Yes. There are a lot! There is a help modal showing all available keyboard shortcuts.

You can see the whole list going to the top right corner menu of the new editor 
and clicking on “Keyboard Shortcuts” (or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift+Alt
+H on Linux/Windows and ⌃⌥H on macOS).

Here is a brief animation illustrating how to find and use the keyboard shortcuts:

![GIF showing how to access keyboard shortcuts](https://i0.wp.com/make.wordpress.
org/core/files/2020/07/keyboard-shortcuts.gif?ssl=1)

### 󠀁[Does Gutenberg support columns?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#does-gutenberg-support-columns)󠁿

Yes, a columns block is available in Gutenberg.

### 󠀁[Does Gutenberg support nested blocks?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#does-gutenberg-support-nested-blocks)󠁿

Yes, it is supported. You can have multiple levels of nesting – blocks within blocks
within blocks. See the [Nested Block Tutorial](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/tutorials/block-tutorial/nested-blocks-inner-blocks/)
for more information.

### 󠀁[Does drag and drop work for rearranging blocks?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#does-drag-and-drop-work-for-rearranging-blocks)󠁿

Yes, you can drag and drop blocks to rearrange their order.

## 󠀁[The Development Experience](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#the-development-experience)󠁿

### 󠀁[How do I make my own block?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#how-do-i-make-my-own-block)󠁿

The best place to start is the [Create a Block Tutorial](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/create-block/).

### 󠀁[Does Gutenberg involve editing posts/pages in the front end?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#does-gutenberg-involve-editing-posts-pages-in-the-front-end)󠁿

No, we are designing Gutenberg primarily as a replacement for the post and page 
editing screens. That said, front-end editing is often confused with an editor that
looks exactly like the front end. And that is something that Gutenberg will allow
as themes customize individual blocks and provide those styles to the editor. Since
content is designed to be distributed across so many different experiences—from 
desktop and mobile to full-text feeds and syndicated article platforms—we believe
it’s not ideal to create or design posts from just one front-end experience.

### 󠀁[Given Gutenberg is built in JavaScript, how do old meta boxes (PHP) work?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#given-gutenberg-is-built-in-javascript-how-do-old-meta-boxes-php-work)󠁿

See the [Meta Box Tutorial](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/metabox/)
for more information on using Meta boxes with the new block editor.

### 󠀁[How can plugins extend the Gutenberg UI?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#how-can-plugins-extend-the-gutenberg-ui)󠁿

The main extension point we want to emphasize is creating new blocks. Blocks are
added to the block editor using plugins, see the [Build your first block Tutorial](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/tutorial/)
to get started.

### 󠀁[Are Custom Post Types still supported?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#are-custom-post-types-still-supported)󠁿

Indeed. There are multiple ways in which custom post types can leverage Gutenberg.
The plan is to allow them to specify the blocks they support, as well as defining
a default block for the post type. It’s not currently the case, but if a post type
disables the content field, the “advanced” section at the bottom would fill the 
page.

## 󠀁[Styles](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#styles)󠁿

### 󠀁[Can themes style blocks?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#can-themes-style-blocks)󠁿

Yes. Blocks can provide their own styles, which themes can add to or override, or
they can provide no styles at all and rely fully on what the theme provides.

### 󠀁[How do block styles work in both the front-end and back-end?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#how-do-block-styles-work-in-both-the-front-end-and-back-end)󠁿

Blocks are able to provide base structural CSS styles, and themes can add styles
on top of this. Some blocks, like a Separator (`<hr/>`), likely don’t need any front-
end styles, while others, like a Gallery, need a few.

Other features, like the new _wide_ and _full-wide_ alignment options, are simply
CSS classes applied to blocks that offer this alignment. We are looking at how a
theme can opt into this feature, for example using `add_theme_support`.

This is currently a work in progress and we recommend reviewing the [block based theme documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/block-themes/)
to learn more.

### 󠀁[What are block variations? Are they the same as block styles?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#what-are-block-variations-are-they-the-same-as-block-styles)󠁿

No, [block variations](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-variations/)
are different versions of a single base block, sharing a similar functionality but
with slight differences in their implementation or settings (attributes, InnerBlocks,
etc.). Block variations are transparent for users, and once there is a registered
block variation, it will appear as a new block. For example, the `embed` block registers
different block variations to embed content from specific providers.

Meanwhile, [block styles](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/filters/block-filters/#block-style-variations)
allow you to provide alternative styles to existing blocks, and they work by adding
a `className` to the block’s wrapper. Once a block has registered block styles, 
a block style selector will appear in its sidebar so that users can choose among
the different registered styles.

### 󠀁[How do editor styles work?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#how-do-editor-styles-work)󠁿

Regular editor styles are opt-in and work as is in most cases. Themes can also load
extra stylesheets by using the following hook:

    ```php
    function gutenbergtheme_editor_styles() {
        wp_enqueue_style( 'gutenbergtheme-blocks-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/blocks.css');
    }
    add_action( 'enqueue_block_editor_assets', 'gutenbergtheme_editor_styles' );
    ```

_See:_ [Editor Styles](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-support/#editor-styles)

## 󠀁[Compatibility](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#compatibility)󠁿

### 󠀁[What browsers does Gutenberg support?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#what-browsers-does-gutenberg-support)󠁿

Gutenberg works in modern browsers.

The [list of supported browsers can be found in the Make WordPress handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/browser-support/).
The term “modern browsers” generally refers to the _current and previous two versions_
of each major browser.

Since WordPress 5.8, Gutenberg no longer supports any version of Internet Explorer.

### 󠀁[Should I be concerned that Gutenberg will make my plugin obsolete?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#should-i-be-concerned-that-gutenberg-will-make-my-plugin-obsolete)󠁿

The goal of Gutenberg is not to put anyone out of business. It’s to evolve WordPress
so there’s more business to be had in the future, for everyone.

Aside from enabling a rich post and page building experience, a meta goal is to 
_move WordPress forward_ as a platform. Not only by modernizing the UI, but by modernizing
the foundation.

We realize it’s a big change. We also think there will be many new opportunities
for plugins. WordPress is likely to ship with a range of basic blocks, but there
will be plenty of room for highly tailored premium plugins to augment existing blocks
or add new blocks to the mix.

### 󠀁[Is it possible to opt out of Gutenberg for my site?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#is-it-possible-to-opt-out-of-gutenberg-for-my-site)󠁿

There is a “Classic” block, which is virtually the same as the current editor, except
in block form.

There is also the [Classic Editor plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/)
which restores the previous editor, see the plugin for more information. The WordPress
Core team has committed to supporting the Classic Editor plugin [until December 2021](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/11/07/classic-editor-plugin-support-window/).

### 󠀁[How do custom TinyMCE buttons work in Gutenberg?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#how-do-custom-tinymce-buttons-work-in-gutenberg)󠁿

Custom TinyMCE buttons still work in the “Classic” block, which is a block version
of the classic editor you know today.

Gutenberg comes with a new universal inserter tool, which gives you access to every
block available, searchable, sorted by recency and categories. This inserter tool
levels the playing field for every plugin that adds content to the editor, and provides
a single interface to learn how to use.

### 󠀁[How do shortcodes work in Gutenberg?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#how-do-shortcodes-work-in-gutenberg)󠁿

Shortcodes continue to work as they do now.

However we see the block as an evolution of the `[shortcode]`. Instead of having
to type out code, you can use the universal inserter tray to pick a block and get
a richer interface for both configuring the block and previewing it. We would recommend
people eventually upgrade their shortcodes to be blocks.

### 󠀁[Should I move shortcodes to content blocks?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#should-i-move-shortcodes-to-content-blocks)󠁿

We think so for a variety of reasons including but not limited to:

 * Blocks have visual editing built-in which creates a more rich, dynamic experience
   for building your site.
 * Blocks are simply html and don’t persist things the browser doesn’t understand
   on the front-end. In comparison, if you disable a plugin that powers a shortcode,
   you end up with strange visuals on the front-end (often just showing the shortcode
   in plain text).
 * Blocks will be discovered more readily with the launch of the block directory
   in a way shortcodes never could be allowing for more people to get more functionality.

Ultimately, Blocks are designed to be visually representative of the final look,
and, with the launch of the Block Directory in 5.5, they will become the expected
way in which users will discover and insert content in WordPress.

## 󠀁[Miscellaneous](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#miscellaneous)󠁿

### 󠀁[Is Gutenberg made to be properly accessible?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#is-gutenberg-made-to-be-properly-accessible)󠁿

Accessibility is not an afterthought. Not every aspect of Gutenberg is accessible
at the moment. You can check logged issues [here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/Accessibility%20%28a11y%29).
We understand that WordPress is for everyone, and that accessibility is about inclusion.
This is a key value for us.

If you would like to contribute to the accessibility of Gutenberg, we can always

### 󠀁[How is data stored? I’ve seen HTML comments. What is their purpose?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#how-is-data-stored-ive-seen-html-comments-what-is-their-purpose)󠁿

Our approach—as outlined in [the technical overview introduction](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/01/17/editor-technical-overview/)—
is to augment the existing data format in a way that doesn’t break the decade-and-
a-half-fabric of content WordPress provides. In other terms, this optimizes for 
a format that prioritizes human readability (the HTML document of the web) and easy-
to-render-anywhere over a machine convenient file (JSON in post-meta) that benefits
the editing context primarily.

This also [gives us the flexibility](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/1516)
to store those blocks that are inherently separate from the content stream (reusable
pieces like widgets or small post type elements) elsewhere, and just keep token 
references for their placement.

We suggest you look at the [Gutenberg key concepts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts/)
to learn more about how this aspect of the project works.

### 󠀁[How can I parse the post content back out into blocks in PHP or JS?](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/faq/?output_format=md#how-can-i-parse-the-post-content-back-out-into-blocks-in-php-or-js)󠁿

In JS:

    ```javascript
    var blocks = wp.blocks.parse( postContent );
    ```

In PHP:

    ```php
    $blocks = parse_blocks( $post_content );
    ```

# Block API Reference


Blocks are the fundamental element of the editor. They are the primary way in which
plugins and themes can register their own functionality and extend the capabilities
of the editor.

## 󠀁[Blocks](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts/?output_format=md#blocks)󠁿

Blocks are an abstract unit for structuring and interacting with content. When composed
together they create the content for a webpage. Everything from a paragraph, to 
a video, to the site title is represented as a block.

Blocks come in many different forms but also provide a consistent interface. They
can be inserted, moved, reordered, copied, duplicated, transformed, deleted, dragged,
and combined. Blocks can also be reused, allowing them to be shared across posts
and post types and/or used multiple times in the same post. If it helps, you can
think of blocks as a more graceful shortcode, with rich formatting tools for users
to compose content.

The settings and content of a block can be customized in three main places: the 
block canvas, the block toolbar, and the block inspector.

### 󠀁[Composability](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts/?output_format=md#composability)󠁿

Blocks are meant to be combined in different ways. Blocks are hierarchical in that
a block can be nested within another block. Nested blocks and its container are 
also called _children_ and _parent_ respectively. For example, a _Columns_ block
can be the parent block to multiple child blocks in each of its columns. The API
that governs child block usage is named `InnerBlocks`.

### 󠀁[Data and attributes](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts/?output_format=md#data-and-attributes)󠁿

Blocks understand content as attributes and are serializable to HTML. To this point,
there is a new Block Grammar. Distilled, the block grammar is an HTML comment, either
a self-closing tag or with a beginning tag and ending tag. In the main tag, depending
on the block type and user customizations, there can be a JSON object. This raw 
form of the block is referred to as serialized.

    ```html
    <!-- wp:paragraph {"key": "value"} -->
    <p>Welcome to the world of blocks.</p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
    ```

Blocks can be static or dynamic. Static blocks contain rendered content and an object
of Attributes used to re-render based on changes. Dynamic blocks require server-
side data and rendering while the post content is being generated (rendering).

Each block contains Attributes or configuration settings, which can be sourced from
raw HTML in the content via meta or other customizable origins.

More on [Data format and data flow](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/data-flow/).

### 󠀁[Block transforms](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts/?output_format=md#block-transforms)󠁿

Blocks have the ability to be transformed into other block types. This allows basic
operations like converting a paragraph into a heading, but also more intricate ones
like multiple images becoming a gallery. Block transforms work for single blocks
and for multi-block selections. Internal block variations are also possible transformation
targets.

### 󠀁[Block variations](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts/?output_format=md#block-variations)󠁿

Given a block type, a block variation is a predefined set of its initial attributes.
This API allows creating a single block from which multiple configurations are possible.
Variations provide different possible interfaces, including showing up as entirely
new blocks in the library, or as presets when inserting a new block. Read [the API documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-registration/#variations-optional)
for more details.

**More on blocks**

 * **[Block API](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/)**
 * **[Tutorial: Building A Custom Block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-create-block/)**

## 󠀁[Reusable blocks](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts/?output_format=md#reusable-blocks)󠁿

A reusable blocks is **an instance** of a block (or multiple blocks) that can be
inserted and edited in multiples places, remaining in sync everywhere. If a reusable
block is edited in one place, those changes are reflected across all posts and pages
that block is used. Examples of reusable blocks include a block consisting of a 
heading whose content and a custom color that would be appear on multiple pages 
of the site and sidebar widgets that would appear on every page.

Any edits to a reusable block will appear on every other use of that block, saving
time from having to make the same edit on different posts.

Internally, reusable blocks are stored as a hidden post type (`wp_block`) and are
dynamic blocks that “ref” or reference the `post_id` and return the `post_content`
for that block.

## 󠀁[Patterns](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts/?output_format=md#patterns)󠁿

A [block pattern](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/)
is a group of blocks that have been combined together creating a design pattern.
These design patterns provide a starting point for building more advanced pages 
and layouts quickly, instead of inserting individual blocks. A block pattern can
be as small as a single block or as large as a full page of content. Unlike reusable
blocks, once a pattern is inserted it doesn’t remain in sync with the original content
as the blocks contained are meant to be edited and customized by the user. Underneath
the surface, patterns are just regular blocks composed together. Themes can register
patterns to offer users quick starting points with a design language familiar to
that theme’s aesthetics.

## 󠀁[Templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts/?output_format=md#templates)󠁿

While the post editor concentrates on the content of a post, the [template](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-templates/)
editor allows declaring and editing an entire site using blocks, from header to 
footer. Templates are broken down between templates (that describe a full page) 
and template parts (that describe reusable areas within a template, including semantic
areas like header, sidebar, and footer).

These templates and template parts can be composed together and registered by a 
theme. They are also entirely editable by users using the block editor; a collection
of blocks that interact with different properties and settings of the site (like
the site title, description, logo, navigation, etc) are especially useful when editing
templates and template parts. Customized templates are saved in a `wp_template` 
post type. Block templates include both static pages and dynamic ones, like archives,
singular, home, 404, etc.

Note: custom post types can also be initialized with a starting `post_content` template
that should not be confused with the theme template system described above.

More on [Site editing templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/full-site-editing-templates/).

## 󠀁[Styles](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/key-concepts/?output_format=md#styles)󠁿

Styles, formerly known as Global Styles and as such referenced in the code, is both
an interface that users access through the editor and a configuration system done
through [a `theme.json` file](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/global-settings-and-styles/).
This file absorbs most of the configuration aspects usually scattered through various`
add_theme_support` calls to simplify communicating with the editor. It thus aims
to improve declaring what settings should be enabled, what specific tools a theme
offers (like a custom color palette), the available design tools present, and an
infrastructure that allows to coordinate the styles coming from WordPress, the active
theme, and the user.

## 󠀁[The format](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/data-flow/?output_format=md#the-format)󠁿

A block editor post is the proper block-aware representation of a post: a collection
of semantically consistent descriptions of what each block is and what its essential
data is. This representation only ever exists in memory. It is the [chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_(printing))
in the typesetter’s workshop, ever-shifting as [sorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_(typesetting))
are attached and repositioned.

A block editor post is not the artifact it produces, namely the `post_content`. 
The latter is the printed page, optimized for the reader but retaining its invisible
markings for later editing.

The input and output of the block editor is a tree of block objects with the current
format:

    ```javascript
    const value = [ block1, block2, block3 ];
    ```

### 󠀁[The block object](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/data-flow/?output_format=md#the-block-object)󠁿

Each block object has an id, a set of attributes and potentially a list of child
blocks.

    ```javascript
    const block = {
        clientId, // unique string identifier.
        type, // The block type (paragraph, image...)
        attributes, // (key, value) set of attributes representing the direct properties/content of the current block.
        innerBlocks, // An array of child blocks or inner blocks.
    };
    ```

Note the attributes keys and types, the allowed inner blocks are defined by the 
block type. For example, the core quote block has a `cite` string attribute representing
the cite content while a heading block has a numeric `level` attribute, representing
the level of the heading (1 to 6).

During the lifecycle of the block in the editor, the block object can receive extra
metadata:

 * `isValid`: A boolean representing whether the block is valid or not;
 * `originalContent`: The original HTML serialization of the block.

**Examples**

    ```javascript
    // A simple paragraph block.
    const paragraphBlock1 = {
        clientId: '51828be1-5f0d-4a6b-8099-f4c6f897e0a3',
        type: 'core/paragraph',
        attributes: {
            content: 'This is the <strong>content</strong> of the paragraph block',
            dropCap: true,
        },
    };

    // A separator block.
    const separatorBlock = {
        clientId: '51828be1-5f0d-4a6b-8099-f4c6f897e0a4',
        type: 'core/separator',
        attributes: {},
    };

    // A columns block with a paragraph block on each column.
    const columnsBlock = {
        clientId: '51828be1-5f0d-4a6b-8099-f4c6f897e0a7',
        type: 'core/columns',
        attributes: {},
        innerBlocks: [
            {
                clientId: '51828be1-5f0d-4a6b-8099-f4c6f897e0a5',
                type: 'core/column',
                attributes: {},
                innerBlocks: [ paragraphBlock1 ],
            },
            {
                clientId: '51828be1-5f0d-4a6b-8099-f4c6f897e0a6',
                type: 'core/column',
                attributes: {},
                innerBlocks: [ paragraphBlock2 ],
            },
        ],
    };
    ```

## 󠀁[Serialization and parsing](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/data-flow/?output_format=md#serialization-and-parsing)󠁿

![Diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1iuownt5etcih7rMMvPvh0Mny8zUA1Z28saxjxaWmfJ0/
pub?w=1234&h=453)

This data model, however, is something that lives in memory while editing a post.
It’s not visible to the page viewer when rendered, just like a printed page has 
no trace of the structure of the letters that produced it in the press.

Since the whole WordPress ecosystem has an expectation for receiving HTML when rendering
or editing a post, the block editor transforms its data into something that can 
be saved in `post_content` through serialization. This assures that there’s a single
source of truth for the content, and that this source remains readable and compatible
with all the tools that interact with WordPress content at the present. Were we 
to store the object tree separately, we would face the risk of `post_content` and
the tree getting out of sync and the problem of data duplication in both places.

Thus, the serialization process converts the block tree into HTML using HTML comments
as explicit block delimiters—which can contain the attributes in non-HTML form. 
This is the act of printing invisible marks on the printed page that leave a trace
of the original structured intention.

This is one end of the process. The other is how to recreate the collection of blocks
whenever a post is to be edited again. A formal grammar defines how the serialized
representation of a block editor post should be loaded, just as some basic rules
define how to turn the tree into an HTML-like string. The block editor’s posts aren’t
designed to be edited by hand; they aren’t designed to be edited as HTML documents
because the block editor posts aren’t HTML in essence.

They just happen, incidentally, to be stored inside of `post_content` in a way in
which they require no transformation in order to be viewable by any legacy system.
It’s true that loading the stored HTML into a browser without the corresponding 
machinery might degrade the experience, and if it included dynamic blocks of content,
the dynamic elements may not load, server-generated content may not appear, and 
interactive content may remain static. However, it at least protects against not
being able to view block editor posts on themes and installations that are blocks-
unaware, and it provides the most accessible way to the content. In other words,
the post remains mostly intact even if the saved HTML is rendered as is.

### 󠀁[Delimiters and parsing expression grammar](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/data-flow/?output_format=md#delimiters-and-parsing-expression-grammar)󠁿

We chose instead to try to find a way to keep the formality, explicitness, and unambiguity
in the existing HTML syntax. Within the HTML there were a number of options.

Of these options, a novel approach was suggested: by storing data in HTML comments,
we would know that we wouldn’t break the rest of the HTML in the document, that 
browsers should ignore it, and that we could simplify our approach to parsing the
document.

Unique to HTML comments is the fact that they cannot legitimately exist in ambiguous
places, such as inside of HTML attributes like `<img alt='data-id="14"'>`. Comments
are also quite permissive. Whereas HTML attributes are complicated to parse properly,
comments are quite easily described by a leading `<!--` followed by anything except`--`
until the first `-->`. This simplicity and permissiveness means that the parser 
can be implemented in several ways without needing to understand HTML properly, 
and we have the liberty to use more convenient syntax inside of the comment—we only
need to escape double-hyphen sequences. We take advantage of this in how we store
block attributes: as JSON literals inside the comment.

After running this through the parser, we’re left with a simple object we can manipulate
idiomatically, and we don’t have to worry about escaping or unescaping the data.
It’s handled for us through the serialization process. Because the comments are 
so different from other HTML tags and because we can perform a first-pass to extract
the top-level blocks, we don’t actually depend on having fully valid HTML!

This has dramatic implications for how simple and performant we can make our parser.
These explicit boundaries also protect damage in a single block from bleeding into
other blocks or tarnishing the entire document. It also allows the system to identify
unrecognized blocks before rendering them.

_N.B.:_ The defining aspects of blocks are their semantics and the isolation mechanism
they provide: in other words, their identity. On the other hand, where their data
is stored is a more liberal aspect. Blocks support more than just static local data(
via JSON literals inside the HTML comment or within the block’s HTML), and more 
mechanisms (_e.g._, global blocks or otherwise resorting to storage in complementary`
WP_Post` objects) are expected. See [attributes](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-attributes/)
for details.

### 󠀁[The anatomy of a serialized block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/data-flow/?output_format=md#the-anatomy-of-a-serialized-block)󠁿

When blocks are saved to the content after the editing session, its attributes—depending
on the nature of the block—are serialized to these explicit comment delimiters.

    ```html
    <!-- wp:image -->
    <figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="source.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
    <!-- /wp:image -->
    ```

A purely dynamic block that is to be server-rendered before display could look like
this:

    ```html
    <!-- wp:latest-posts {"postsToShow":4,"displayPostDate":true} /-->
    ```

## 󠀁[The data lifecycle](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/data-flow/?output_format=md#the-data-lifecycle)󠁿

In summary, the block editor workflow parses the saved document to an in-memory 
tree of blocks, using token delimiters to help. During editing, all manipulations
happen within the block tree. The process ends by serializing the blocks back to
the `post_content`.

The workflow process relies on a serialization/parser pair to persist posts. Hypothetically,
the post data structure could be stored using a plugin or retrieved from a remote
JSON file to be converted to the block tree.

# Theme Handbook


_Welcome to the WordPress Theme Developer Handbook, your resource for learning all
about the exciting world of WordPress themes. _

The Theme Developer Handbook is a repository for all things WordPress themes. Whether
you’re new to WordPress themes, or you’re an experienced theme developer, you should
be able to find the answer to many of your theme-related questions right here.

In this handbook, you can learn how to build **block themes or classic themes.**

 * A block theme is a new theme that you can use from WordPress version 5.9. It 
   is built mainly using HTML and a theme configuration file. The block theme is
   composed entirely of blocks, allowing you to edit all parts of your site in the
   Site Editor.
 * A classic theme is the original theme, without version limitations, that primarily
   uses PHP, JavaScript and CSS. Classic themes take advantage of WordPress PHP 
   functions, hooks and filters.

 1. If you’re new to developing WordPress themes, start with section 1, where you can
    [find out what a theme is](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme/),
    learn about [WordPress’ license](https://wordpress.org/about/license/), and [set up your development environment](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup/).
 2. Once you’re through the introduction, continue with the [Core Concepts](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/core-concepts/)
    section.

It is recommended to read through both the block theme section and the classic theme
sections. This will give you an understanding of the differences between the two
types of themes, and help you choose what type of theme to build.

If you’ve got to grips with the basics of themes, check out the [Advanced Theme Topics](https://developer.wordpress.org/theme/advanced-topics/)
to learn about child themes, best UI practices, theme testing and more.

Once you’ve got your theme ready for the world, the final section will cover [releasing your theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/releasing-your-theme/),
teaching you some best practices for theme distribution, and for getting it ready
for the WordPress.org theme directory.

The WordPress Theme Developer Handbook is created by the WordPress community, for
the WordPress community. We are always looking for more contributors; if you’re 
interested stop by the [docs team blog](https://make.wordpress.org/docs) to find
out more about getting involved.

A WordPress theme represents the design of your website. It can control everything
from colors, to fonts, to the entire layout. In essence, what you see when viewing
the front-end of your site is shaped by the theme.

[⌊A collage of site designs at an angle.⌉⌊A collage of site designs at an angle.⌉[

There are 1,000s of free WordPress themes in the [WordPress.org Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/)
and even more from third-party directories and shops. Many people and businesses
also have bespoke (custom-made) themes for their sites.

## 󠀁[What can themes do?](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme/?output_format=md#what-can-themes-do)󠁿

Themes take the content stored by WordPress and display it in the browser. When 
you create a WordPress theme, you decide how that content looks and is displayed.
There are many options available to you when building your theme. The biggest limit
is your imagination. 

As a theme creator, you can:

 * Create different layouts, such as one, two or more columns.
 * Control the typography of the site with custom font choices.
 * Skin the site with any color scheme you want.
 * Put a sidebar on the left or right side of the page. Or, have no sidebar at all.
 * Display featured images alongside posts.

and a three-column grid of posts.⌉⌊The WordPress site editor showing the homepage

Editing a Twenty Twenty-Three theme style variation.

The WordPress theming system is incredibly powerful. As with every web design project,
a good theme is more than defining a layout or two and a few custom colors. The 
best themes improve engagement with a website’s content _in addition_ to being beautiful.

There really are not many limits to the possibilities. Outside of your imagination,
theme creation requires some baseline knowledge, which is covered in the [Reading this handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/reading-this-handbook/)
page of this chapter. That’s what this handbook is all about—_teaching you what 
you need to know to build themes of your own_.

## 󠀁[Theme types](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme/?output_format=md#theme-types)󠁿

WordPress supports two primary types of themes: **block** and **classic**.

There is also a classic subtype that is called a **hybrid** theme, and you’ll learn
about it below, too. But the most important distinction is block vs. classic.

Technically, you can even build your own theming system altogether. That’s outside
the scope of this handbook, but it’s at least worth noting that WordPress lets you
build pretty much whatever you set your mind to.

### 󠀁[Block themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme/?output_format=md#block-themes)󠁿

Block themes are the modern method of building WordPress themes. They generally 
follow a standard set of conventions and are built entirely out of blocks. This 
handbook will primarily focus on building themes using this method because it is
the future of the WordPress project.

Block themes rely on HTML-based [block templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/)
that contain block markup. Both creators and users can edit the templates in the
Site Editor. Users can also customize [global settings and styles](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/)
defined by the theme’s `theme.json` file through the Styles interface. 

It’s also possible to export a theme directly from the Site Editor without touching
any code. Technically, you cannot create a new theme from scratch entirely from 
the editor, but you can modify the templates and styles of an existing theme—in 
essence, creating a custom theme of your own.

background and black text.⌉⌊WordPress site editor with a single post template that

### 󠀁[Classic themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme/?output_format=md#classic-themes)󠁿

Classic themes use a PHP-based templating system, which is still supported in WordPress
today. They are still in wide use because they were built on the theming system 
that was first introduced in 2005 with the launch of [WordPress 1.5](https://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/).
There is a long and deep history of classic theming in WordPress, which continues
on. For this reason, the handbook maintains documentation for classic themes in 
the [Classic Themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/classic-themes/) chapter.

Unlike block themes, classic themes have far fewer standards to adhere to, but there
are APIs you can use for specific features. The classic theme creation process also
requires some minimal PHP, HTML, and CSS code knowledge, at least.

Editing the default Twenty Twenty theme styles in the customizer.

### 󠀁[Hybrid themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme/?output_format=md#hybrid-themes)󠁿

Hybrid themes are merely classic themes that have adopted some modern block-related
features, such as [global settings and styles](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/)
or [block template parts](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/template-parts/).
This is a widely agreed-upon term by the community, but it is not an “official” 
theme type. At the end of the day, hybrids are still classic themes.

## 󠀁[Become familiar with themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme/?output_format=md#become-familiar-with-themes)󠁿

To build a WordPress theme of your own, you should familiarize yourself with how
themes work from a user’s viewpoint. Before diving into the creation process, try
[installing a theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/work-with-themes/)
and playing around with it.

WordPress comes with several default themes, titled _Twenty [Year]_, but you should
also try other themes from the [Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/) 
just to get a feel for the possibilities.

## 󠀁[What are themes made of?](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme/?output_format=md#what-are-themes-made-of)󠁿

Themes can include many different folders and file types. The list below is non-
exhaustive, but it includes some of common things you might see:

 * Templates (`.html` in block themes and `.php` in classic themes)
 * CSS Stylesheets
 * JavaScript
 * PHP
 * Media (images, audio, video, etc.)
 * JSON

You will learn more about the specific folders and files used to create a theme 
in the next chapter: [Core Concepts](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/core-concepts).

## 󠀁[What is the difference between themes and plugins?](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/what-is-a-theme/?output_format=md#what-is-the-difference-between-themes-and-plugins)󠁿

It is common for there to be overlap between features found in themes and plugins.
However, best practices are:

 * Themes control the _presentation_ of content.
 * Plugins control the behaviors and features of your site.

Any theme that you create should not add site-critical functionality. Doing so means
that a user loses access to that functionality when they change their theme.

For example, say you build a theme with a portfolio feature. Users who build their
portfolio with your feature will lose it when they change themes. By leaving critical
features to plugins, you make it possible to change the design of a website while
its features remain intact.

Remember, some users switch themes often. It is best practice to make sure any functionality
their sites require, even if the design changes, is in a separate plugin.

In this document, you will learn about the tools that you will need to get off to
a solid start when building WordPress themes. You will also find resources on setting
up a development environment for testing your projects. 

While it is definitely possible to create and build block themes without any of 
these tools, they are foundational pieces of a good workflow.

## 󠀁[Development environment](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup/?output_format=md#development-environment)󠁿

When building WordPress themes, it is a good idea to do it within an environment
that is separate from a live (i.e., production) site. Before creating your first
WordPress theme, you should set up a development environment.

Don’t let this process scare you if it’s your first time. In the long run, you will
be happy you learned how to set this up.

### 󠀁[Why set up a development environment?](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup/?output_format=md#why-set-up-a-development-environment)󠁿

Development environments allow you to test code before it goes live on a production
site. You don’t want to change something, push it live, and later realize you created
a fatal error that took down the whole website. 

By using a development environment, you can test things to ensure they work before
they are live.

Your development environment can either be local (on your computer) or on a remote
server. But configuring a local environment to work on your theme is beneficial 
for several reasons:

 * You do not need an internet connection to build your theme.
 * You can build your theme without relying on a remote server. This speeds up the
   building process, and you can see changes instantly in your browser.
 * You can test your theme from many perspectives. This is important if you plan
   on releasing it to a larger audience and want maximum compatibility.

### 󠀁[Setting up a local development environment](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup/?output_format=md#setting-up-a-local-development-environment)󠁿

For developing WordPress themes, you need to set up a development environment that
is suited to WordPress. This list is not exhaustive, but here are several options
to choose from:

 * [@wordpress/env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-env/)(
   local WordPress environment package)
 * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
 * [WordPress Studio](https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/)
 * [Local](https://localwp.com/)
 * [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/mac/)
 * [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)
 * [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/) (VVV)

For more information, read the [Setting Up a Development Environment](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-local-server/)
documentation in the Core Handbook.

## 󠀁[Installing WordPress](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup/?output_format=md#installing-wordpress)󠁿

Before you begin building themes in your development environment, you must also 
install WordPress. 

Some of the development environments include methods for automatically installing
an instance of WordPress. You can skip this step if this is the case for you.

To install WordPress on your own, follow the [How to install WordPress](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/howto-install/)
documentation from the Advanced Administration handbook. Then, of course, come back
here and learn more about creating WordPress themes!

## 󠀁[Code editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup/?output_format=md#code-editor)󠁿

> _A good code editor is worth its weight in gold._
>  Someone Wise

On a more serious note, a good code editor gives you proper syntax highlighting,
error reporting, integration with version control systems (VCS), and much more. 
It’s there to make your life easier.

Technically, you could edit code in a plain text editor, but you’d be missing out
on all the best features that true code editors and IDEs (Integrated Development
Environments) bring to life.

[⌊Visual Studio Code editor program with a theme's single.html file open, showing
block markup.⌉⌊Visual Studio Code editor program with a theme's single.html file
open, showing block markup.⌉[

Editing a theme’s `single.html` template in Visual Studio Code

There are many free and open-source editors to choose from. Here are some of the
more popular ones:

 * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code)
 * [VIM](https://www.vim.org/)
 * [Brackets](https://brackets.io/)
 * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
 * [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
 * [TextMate](https://macromates.com/)

There are also many proprietary editors that are free or cost a fee to use. Whatever
you decide to use, pick something you feel comfortable with.

## 󠀁[Other development tools](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup/?output_format=md#other-development-tools)󠁿

A code editor and development environment are the foundational pieces of creating
a WordPress theme. However, there are other tools and resources that you will likely
find useful for your project.

### 󠀁[Test data](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup/?output_format=md#test-data)󠁿

WordPress allows you to [import XML files](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/importing-content/)
containing real or dummy data for testing your themes. This lets you see how your
theme performs with different types of content and layouts. Here are two options
for importing:

 * [WordPress.org Theme Test Data](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test)
 * [WordPress.com Theme Test Data](http://themetest.wordpress.com/) _(includes WordPress.
   com-specific data)_

If nothing else, you need some type of demo/test content to see what your theme 
looks like in action. You could even create test posts and pages of your own!

### 󠀁[Plugins](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup/?output_format=md#plugins)󠁿

In addition to test data, there are several WordPress plugins that can help make
sure your theme is following standard practices and not producing debugging notices.
These are optional but can be useful:

 * [Theme Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/): Tests your theme for
   compliance with the latest WordPress standards and practices.
 * [Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/): Adds an admin bar to your
   WordPress admin and provides a central location for debugging.
 * [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/): Allows debugging
   of database queries, API requests, and AJAX used to generate theme pages and 
   functionality.
 * [Log Deprecated Notices](https://wordpress.org/plugins/log-deprecated-notices/):
   Logs incorrect function usage, deprecated file usage, and deprecated function
   usage in your theme.
 * [Monster Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/monster-widget/): Consolidates
   the core WordPress widgets into a single widget, making it easier to test them
   all at once (_classic themes only_).

## 󠀁[WordPress.org Theme Review Guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/tools-and-setup/?output_format=md#wordpress-org-theme-review-guidelines)󠁿

It is a good idea to stay up to date with the [theme guidelines](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/)
provided by the WordPress.org Themes Team. These guidelines are required if you 
plan to submit your theme to the official [Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes),
but they are also good principles for anyone creating a theme.

You should also follow the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/)
when writing any code for your theme. This will help make sure what you are creating
meets some minimum quality standards.

The first step is always the hardest to take. Now that you’ve made it this far into
the Getting Started chapter, you’ve already taken several steps. Congratulations
on getting through all of the necessary setup.

In a way, actually building your first theme can feel like another first step, but
you are ready to trek out into the wilderness and beyond. Don’t worry—this guide
will walk with you as you set out on this journey.

## 󠀁[Activating your first theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/quick-start-guide/?output_format=md#activating-your-first-theme)󠁿

One of the best ways to understand how to build themes is to look at and study existing
themes. 

Even in advanced development circles, one of the cornerstones of sound development
is to reuse code. This is because developers understand that this is the most efficient
way to get things done, and many try to abide by the “don’t reinvent the wheel” 
mantra.

Regardless of whether you are a developer, this is sound advice. You don’t need 
to build everything from scratch. There’s a good chance that most of what you want
to do has already been created by someone else.

So, your next step is to activate an existing theme.

### 󠀁[Choosing a theme to learn from](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/quick-start-guide/?output_format=md#choosing-a-theme-to-learn-from)󠁿

Packaged in every version of WordPress since version 3.0 (and named after the year
they were released in), the default themes are some of the best to study how themes
are built. This is because they are designed with broad use in mind and fully adhere
to WordPress coding standards.

Because this handbook primarily focuses on modern, block theming, you should choose
one of the newest default themes:

 * [Twenty Twenty-Four](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfour/)
 * [Twenty Twenty-Three](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/)
 * [Twenty Twenty-Two](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/) 

It’s typically best to use the latest default theme. This is because it will be 
built with the most up-to-date features in mind. Plus, it should already be activated
if you’ve recently installed WordPress:

[⌊WordPress Appearance > Theme admin screen, showing the Twenty Twenty-Four theme
activated.⌉⌊WordPress Appearance > Theme admin screen, showing the Twenty Twenty-
Four theme activated.⌉[

You can also choose any theme from the official [Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/)
to learn from, but for the purposes of this guide, it should be a [block theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/).
For more information on installing and activating themes, read the [Work with themes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/work-with-themes/)
documentation.

If your interests lie in classic WordPress, you should jump forward to the [Classic Themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/classic-themes/)
chapter for more details on building classic themes.

## 󠀁[Customizing your theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/quick-start-guide/?output_format=md#customizing-your-theme)󠁿

Once you’ve activated a block theme, take some time to simply have fun exploring
and tinkering with the available options in the [Site Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/).
Essentially, this is an editable, visual representation of your theme in the WordPress
admin.

And, as promised earlier in the Getting Started chapter, you can build your theme
entirely from this interface without touching a single line of code.

You can locate the Site Editor via **Appearance > Editor **in the WordPress admin
menu. Once opened, your screen should look similar to this:

[⌊WordPress Site Editor with the Design menu shown in the left panel. In the preview
panel is the homepage of the Twenty Twenty-Four theme.⌉⌊WordPress Site Editor with
the Design menu shown in the left panel. In the preview panel is the homepage of
the Twenty Twenty-Four theme.⌉[

There are a lot of pieces to this, and you can find yourself lost for hours just
tinkering around in the Site Editor. It can be fun, and you’ll learn more about 
how this integrates with your theme as you read through this handbook. For now, 
let’s get to the basics of “creating” a theme.

This part of the journey can be entirely self-directed, so feel free to do this 
at your own pace and in your own way. But most people will want to begin by adjusting
their design. 

You can do this by first selecting the **Styles** item in the menu panel:

[⌊WordPress Styles screen under the Site Editor in the admin. The left panel shows
several style variation options.⌉⌊WordPress Styles screen under the Site Editor 
in the admin. The left panel shows several style variation options.⌉[

The Twenty Twenty-Four theme (and many other block themes) include pre-designed 
style variations, which you can see in the sidebar in the above screenshot. You 
will learn more about these variations in the [Global Settings and Styles](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/)
chapter, but feel free to use one as a starting point for your own customizations.

The next step is to select the **Style Book** icon (it looks like an eye). Opening
this screen will give you full access to modifying the global styles of the site:

[⌊Style Book screen under the WordPress Site Editor in the admin. It shows a tabbed
overlay with various blocks.⌉⌊Style Book screen under the WordPress Site Editor 
in the admin. It shows a tabbed overlay with various blocks.⌉[

At this point, _the world is your oyster_—in other words, feel free to let your 
creativity run wild. But most importantly, get a feel for what settings and styles
are available in the interface. This familiarity will come in hand as you dive into
more advanced sections of the handbook.

For a deeper dive into using the Style Book, read this guide from the WordPress 
Developer Blog: [The Style Book: a one-stop shop for styling block themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/06/the-style-book-a-one-stop-shop-for-styling-block-themes/).

## 󠀁[Exporting your theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/quick-start-guide/?output_format=md#exporting-your-theme)󠁿

Once you’ve customized the theme to your liking, be sure to hit the **Save** button.
When you’re ready, you will “create” your first theme.

You have two options for doing this. The first is to use the built-in exporter from
the Site Editor in WordPress. The second is to use the [Create Block Theme](https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/)
plugin, which has more extensive options available. There are instructions for both
methods below.

### 󠀁[Exporting from the Styles interface](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/quick-start-guide/?output_format=md#exporting-from-the-styles-interface)󠁿

To export your theme from the Site Editor interface, click the **⋮ (Options)** button
in the header area. You will see a dropdown of available options. Click the **Export**
option, as shown below:

[⌊WordPress Site Editor with the Options menu dropdown open. The Export option is
highlighted.⌉⌊WordPress Site Editor with the Options menu dropdown open. The Export
option is highlighted.⌉[

This will give you a ZIP file with your complete theme in it. The filename will 
match that of the theme you were working from. In the case of the default Twenty
Twenty-Four theme, it will be `twentytwentyfour.zip`.

**_Congratulations!_** You have now successfully created your first WordPress theme.

You were assured that you could create a theme without touching code. That was the
truth. You have built a theme that can be uploaded to any WordPress website just
like any other theme.

But there was a _fib_—a harmless white lie—mixed in with that truth about there 
being no code involved. 

The theme you downloaded is still named “Twenty Twenty-Four,” and it’s best to rename
it so that it’s representative of what you’ve created. To do this, unzip the `twentytwentyfour.
zip` folder and rename it to `your-theme-name`. 

Then, open the `style.css` file within that folder. You should see something like
this at the top of the file:

    ```language-css
    /*
    Theme Name: Twenty Twenty-Four
    Theme URI: https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfour/
    Author: the WordPress team
    Author URI: https://wordpress.org
    ...
    ```

At the very least, you should adjust those first four lines, particularly the `Theme
Name` value. And that’s all the code you _really_ have to touch.

As a final step, zip the file again with whatever utility program you have on your
computer for creating ZIP files.

### 󠀁[Using the Create Block Theme plugin](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/quick-start-guide/?output_format=md#using-the-create-block-theme-plugin)󠁿

The [Create Block Theme](https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/) plugin
is an official, first-party plugin that WordPress contributors maintain. Often, 
you will see new ideas for exporting themes tried and tested here before they land
in WordPress.

The plugin is more robust than what you will find in core WordPress, meaning that
it has many more options for exporting your theme. This guide will only cover the
basics of exporting your theme, but feel free to explore the plugin’s features in
more detail.

Once you’ve activated Create Block Theme, you should see a new button in the Site
Editor that is displayed as a wrench icon. Click this button to open the **Create
Block Theme** menu.

You will see several options for saving changes, exporting a ZIP, editing theme 
info, and creating a new theme:

[⌊WordPress Site Editor with a "tool" icon in the top right. A menu is open titled"
Create Block Theme" and has several options.⌉⌊WordPress Site Editor with a "tool"
icon in the top right. A menu is open titled "Create Block Theme" and has several
options.⌉[

You can use the **Export ZIP** option to export the theme as you did earlier.

But Create Block Theme offers more customization options that you’ll want to use
for truly creating a custom theme. Click on the **Create Theme** option:

[⌊WordPress Site Editor with the Create Block Theme > Create Theme menu open. Several
fields are shown within the menu panel.⌉⌊WordPress Site Editor with the Create Block
Theme > Create Theme menu open. Several fields are shown within the menu panel.⌉[

From there, you’ll be able to customize all of the information about your theme 
to make it unique. Once finished, click the **Export Theme** button for your new
theme.

The one thing that Create Block Theme does not yet do is let you upload a custom
screenshot. You’ll still need to add a unique `screenshot.[png|jpg]` file in your
theme if you intend to distribute to others.

# Theme Basics


In this chapter, you’ll begin learning how to build a theme. The anatomy of a theme
and its parts will be broken down and explained.

You’ll begin by understanding the concepts of building a theme by looking at [theme files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/)
and [post types](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/post-types/). Then
you’ll learn how to keep your files [organized](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/organizing-theme-files/)
within your theme.

You’ll also look at [The Loop](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/),
which is responsible for pulling content out of the WordPress database.

Finally, you’ll learn more about adding features to your theme by [using theme functions](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/theme-functions/),
[including CSS & JavaScript](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/including-css-javascript/),
leveraging [conditional tags](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/conditional-tags/)
to only show content you need, and working with [default taxonomies and creating your own](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/categories-tags-custom-taxonomies/).

# Advanced Topics


Welcome to the advanced theme topics documentation. In this chapter, you will learn
about some of the more complex features, techniques, and more that are not covered
in previous chapters.

While this chapter is considered “advanced” it doesn’t mean you cannot learn something
if you’re still getting started on your theme development journey. In many ways,
the articles in this chapter are essential if you plan to distribute your theme 
to others, such as through the [WordPress Theme Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/).

## Navigating this chapter

Use the following links to locate a topic within this chapter. Each article covers
a specific topic that is relevant to theme development, and you can explore each
at your own pace.

    - [Resources](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security/theme-security-issues/?output_format=md#resources)


Please do not report security issues with WordPress Core to the themes team. To 
report an issue with WordPress itself, [follow the directions for reporting security vulnerabilities.](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/)

If you have found a **plugin** with a security issue, please read [Reporting Plugin Security Issues](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/plugin-security/reporting-plugin-security-issues/)

## 󠀁[How to report a theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security/theme-security-issues/?output_format=md#how-to-report-a-theme)󠁿

If you find a theme with a security issue, please **do not** post about it publicly
anywhere. Even if there’s a report filed on one of the official security tracking
sites, bringing more awareness to the security issue tends to increase people being
hacked, and rarely speeds up the fixing.

To report a theme that is in the WordPress.org theme directory, please go to the
theme’s directory listing (For example, [https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/))
and use the “**Report this theme**” button in the sidebar, and complete the form.

[[

You can also send reports of security issues to `themes@wordpress.org`. Include
the following:

 * a clear and concise description of the issue
 * a link to the specific theme
 * whether or not you have validated the security issue yourself
 * **optional** – links to any public disclosures on 3rd party sites

If your theme has been reported and the Themes Team decides that action needs to
be taken, you will receive an email from the Themes Team with information and instructions.
–
You may be asked to solve an issue within a specific time frame. This depends on
the severity of the issue.– The Themes Team may need to suspend your theme to prevent
new downloads until the issue is resolved.**You must reply to the email if you have
any questions, need more information, or need more time.

Test your theme update carefully and submit it through the [upload form on the theme directory page](https://wordpress.org/themes/upload/).

# REST API Handbook

## In this article

 * [What Is A REST API?](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/?output_format=md#what-is-a-rest-api)
 * [Using the WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/?output_format=md#using-the-wordpress-rest-api)
 * [Next Steps](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/?output_format=md#next-steps)


The WordPress REST API provides an interface for applications to interact with your
WordPress site by sending and receiving data as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)(
JavaScript Object Notation) objects. It is the foundation of the [WordPress Block Editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/),
and can likewise enable your theme, plugin or custom application to present new,
powerful interfaces for managing and publishing your site content.

Using the WordPress REST API you can create a plugin to provide an entirely new 
admin experience for WordPress, build a brand new interactive front-end experience,
or bring your WordPress content into completely separate applications.

The REST API is a developer-oriented feature of WordPress. It provides data access
to the content of your site, and implements the same authentication restrictions—
content that is public on your site is generally publicly accessible via the REST
API, while private content, password-protected content, internal users, custom post
types, and metadata is only available with authentication or if you specifically
set it to be so. If you are not a developer, the most important thing to understand
about the API is that it enables the block editor and modern plugin interfaces without
compromising the security or privacy of your site.

## 󠀁[What Is A REST API?](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/?output_format=md#what-is-a-rest-api)󠁿

An API is an Application Programming Interface. REST, standing for “REpresentational
State Transfer,” is a set of concepts for modeling and accessing your application’s
data as interrelated objects and collections. The WordPress REST API provides REST
endpoints (URLs) representing the posts, pages, taxonomies, and other built-in WordPress
data types. Your application can send and receive JSON data to these endpoints to
query, modify and create content on your site. JSON is an open standard data format
that is lightweight and human-readable, and looks like Objects do in JavaScript.
When you request content from or send content to the API, the response will also
be returned in JSON. Because JSON is widely supported in many programming languages,
developers can build WordPress applications in client-side JavaScript (like the 
block editor), as mobile apps, or as desktop or command line tools.

The REST API is just one of many APIs provided by WordPress. You can find the [documentation on these additional APIs here](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_APIs).

## 󠀁[Using the WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/?output_format=md#using-the-wordpress-rest-api)󠁿

WordPress already provides a rich set of tools and interfaces for building sites,
and you should not feel pressured to use the REST API if your site is already working
the way you expect. You do not need to use the REST API to build a WordPress theme
or plugin.

However, if you do wish to write your theme, plugin, or external application as 
a client-side JavaScript application, or a standalone program in a language other
than PHP, then your application will need a structured way to access content within
your WordPress site. Any programming language which can make HTTP requests and interpret
JSON can use the REST API to interact with WordPress, from PHP, Node.js, Go, and
Java, to Swift, Kotlin, and beyond.

Even if you’re using vanilla JavaScript or jQuery within a theme or plugin the REST
API provides a more predictable and structured way to interact with your site’s 
content than [`admin-ajax`](https://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins), enabling
you to spend less time accessing the data you need and more time creating better
user experiences.

If you want a structured, extensible, and simple way to get data in and out of WordPress,
you probably want to use the REST API.

For all of its simplicity the REST API can feel quite complex at first, so in this
handbook we will attempt to break it down into smaller components to explain each
part of the full puzzle.

## 󠀁[Next Steps](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/?output_format=md#next-steps)󠁿

Familiarize yourself with the [key technical concepts](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/)
behind how the REST API functions.

Learn more about how to interact with API resources and query for specific data 
in the [Using the REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/)
section.

Once you’re comfortable with the default workings of the default routes and methods,
discover how to add new data to the API or enhance and manipulate existing response
objects in the [Extending the REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/extending-the-rest-api/)
section.

For a comprehensive overview of the resources and routes available by default, review
the [API reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/).

 * [Requests](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/?output_format=md#requests)

 * [Schema](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/?output_format=md#schema)
 * [Controller Classes](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/?output_format=md#controller-classes)


In this page we’ll break down some of the key concepts and terms associated with
the REST API: **Routes & Endpoints,** **Requests**, **Responses**, **Schema**, and**
Controller Classes**. Each of these concepts play a crucial role in understanding,
using, and extending the WordPress REST API, and each is explored in greater depth
within this handbook.

## 󠀁[Routes & Endpoints](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/?output_format=md#routes-endpoints)󠁿

In the context of the WordPress REST API a **route** is a URI which can be mapped
to different HTTP methods. The mapping of an individual HTTP method to a route is
known as an **endpoint**.

As an example, if we make a `GET` request to the URI `http://oursite.com/wp-json/`
we are returned a JSON response showing what routes are available, and what endpoints
are available within each route.

`/wp-json/` is a route, and when that route receives a `GET` request then that request
is handled by the endpoint which displays what is known as the index for the WordPress
REST API.

The route `wp-json/wp/v2/posts` by contrast has a `GET` endpoint which returns a
list of posts, but also a `POST` endpoint which accepts authenticated requests to
create new posts.

We will learn how to register our own routes and endpoints in the following sections.

If you are using [non-pretty permalinks](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-permalinks/),
you should pass the REST API route as a query string parameter. The route `http://
oursite.com/wp-json/` in the example above would hence be `http://oursite.com/?rest_route
=/`.

If you get a `404` error when trying to access `http://oursite.com/wp-json/`, consider
enabling pretty permalinks or try using the `rest_route` parameter instead.

## 󠀁[Requests](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/?output_format=md#requests)󠁿

A REST API request is represented within WordPress by an instance of the `WP_REST_Request`
class, which is used to store and retrieve information for the current request. 
A `WP_REST_Request` object is automatically generated when you make an HTTP request
to a registered API route.

The data specified in this object (derived from the route URI or the JSON payload
sent as a part of the request) determines what response you will get back out of
the API.

Requests are usually submitted remotely via HTTP but may also be made internally
from PHP within WordPress plugin or theme code. There are a lot of neat things you
can do using this class, detailed further elsewhere in the handbook.

## 󠀁[Responses](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/?output_format=md#responses)󠁿

Responses are the data you get back from the API. The `WP_REST_Response` class provides
a way to interact with the response data returned by endpoints. Responses return
the requested data, or can also be used to return errors if something goes wrong
while fulfilling the request.

## 󠀁[Schema](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/?output_format=md#schema)󠁿

Each endpoint requires a particular structure of input data, and returns data using
a defined and predictable structure. Those data structures are defined in the API
Schema.

The schema structures API data and provides a comprehensive list of all of the properties
the API can return and which input parameters it can accept.

Well-defined schema also provides one layer of security within the API, as it enables
us to validate and sanitize the requests being made to the API. The [Schema section](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/extending-the-rest-api/schema/)
explores this large topic further.

## 󠀁[Controller Classes](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/?output_format=md#controller-classes)󠁿

Controller classes unify and coordinate all these various moving parts within a 
REST API response cycle. With a controller class you can manage the registration
of routes & endpoints, handle requests, utilize schema, and generate API responses.

A single class usually contains all of the logic for a given route, and a given 
route usually represents a specific type of data object within your WordPress site(
like a custom post type or taxonomy).

# Reference

## In this article

 * [REST API Developer Endpoint Reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/?output_format=md#rest-api-developer-endpoint-reference)
 * [A Distributed API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/?output_format=md#a-distributed-api)


The WordPress REST API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer),
and is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response
codes to indicate API errors. The API uses built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication
and HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and supports
cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with the API from
a client-side web application.

The REST API uses JSON exclusively as the request and response format, including
error responses. While the REST API does not completely conform to the [HAL standard](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html),
it does implement HAL’s `._links` and `._embedded` properties for linking API resources,
and is fully discoverable via hyperlinks in the responses.

The REST API provides public data accessible to any client anonymously, as well 
as private data only available after [authentication](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/authentication/).
Once authenticated the REST API supports most content management actions, allowing
you to build alternative dashboards for a site, enhance your plugins with more responsive
management tools, or build complex single-page applications.

This API reference provides information on the specific endpoints available through
the API, their parameters, and their response data format.

## 󠀁[A Distributed API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/?output_format=md#a-distributed-api)󠁿

Unlike many other REST APIs, the WordPress REST API is distributed and available
individually on each site that supports it. This means there is no singular API 
root or base to contact; instead, we have [a discovery process](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/discovery/)
that allows interacting with sites without prior contact. The API also exposes self-
documentation at the index endpoint, or via an `OPTIONS` request to any endpoint,
allowing human- or machine-discovery of endpoint capabilities.

# Authentication

## In this article

 * [Cookie Authentication](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/?output_format=md#cookie-authentication)
 * [Basic Authentication with Application Passwords](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/?output_format=md#basic-authentication-with-application-passwords)
 * [Authentication Plugins](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/?output_format=md#authentication-plugins)


## 󠀁[Cookie Authentication](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/?output_format=md#cookie-authentication)󠁿

Cookie authentication is the standard authentication method included with WordPress.
When you log in to your dashboard, this sets up the cookies correctly for you, so
plugin and theme developers need only to have a logged-in user.

However, the REST API includes a technique called [nonces](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/nonces/)
to avoid [CSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) issues.
This prevents other sites from forcing you to perform actions without explicitly
intending to do so. This requires slightly special handling for the API.

For developers using the built-in Javascript API, this is handled automatically 
for you. This is the recommended way to use the API for plugins and themes. Custom
data models can extend `wp.api.models.Base` to ensure this is sent correctly for
any custom requests.

For developers making manual Ajax requests, the nonce will need to be passed with
each request. The API uses nonces with the action set to `wp_rest`. These can then
be passed to the API via the `_wpnonce` data parameter (either POST data or in the
query for GET requests), or via the `X-WP-Nonce` header. If no nonce is provided
the API will set the current user to 0, turning the request into an **unauthenticated
request**, even if you’re logged into WordPress.

Note: Until recently, most software had spotty support for `DELETE` requests. For
instance, PHP doesn’t transform the request body of a `DELETE` request into a super
global. As such, supplying the nonce as a header is the most reliable approach.

It is important to keep in mind that this authentication method relies on WordPress
cookies. As a result this method is only applicable when the REST API is used inside
of WordPress and the current user is logged in. In addition, the current user must
have the appropriate capability to perform the action being performed.

As an example, this is how the built-in Javascript client creates the nonce:

    ```php
    <?php
    wp_localize_script( 'wp-api', 'wpApiSettings', array(
        'root' => esc_url_raw( rest_url() ),
        'nonce' => wp_create_nonce( 'wp_rest' )
    ) );
    ```

This is then used in the base model:

    ```javascript
    options.beforeSend = function(xhr) {
        xhr.setRequestHeader('X-WP-Nonce', wpApiSettings.nonce);

        if (beforeSend) {
            return beforeSend.apply(this, arguments);
        }
    };
    ```

Here is an example of editing the title of a post, using jQuery AJAX:

    ```javascript
    $.ajax( {
        url: wpApiSettings.root + 'wp/v2/posts/1',
        method: 'POST',
        beforeSend: function ( xhr ) {
            xhr.setRequestHeader( 'X-WP-Nonce', wpApiSettings.nonce );
        },
        data:{
            'title' : 'Hello Moon'
        }
    } ).done( function ( response ) {
        console.log( response );
    } );
    ```

Note that you do not need to verify that the nonce is valid inside your custom end
point. This is automatically done for you in `rest_cookie_check_errors()`.

## 󠀁[Basic Authentication with Application Passwords](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/?output_format=md#basic-authentication-with-application-passwords)󠁿

As of 5.6, WordPress has shipped with [Application Passwords](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/11/05/application-passwords-integration-guide/),
which can be generated from an Edit User page (wp-admin -> Users -> Edit User).

The credentials can be passed along to REST API requests served over https:// using
[Basic Auth](https://ec.haxx.se/libcurl-http/auth.html#basic) / [RFC 7617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617)—
[here’s the documentation for how to use it with cURL](https://ec.haxx.se/http/auth.html).

For a simple command-line script example, just swap out USERNAME, PASSWORD, and 
HOSTNAME in this with their respective values:

    ```
    curl --user "USERNAME:PASSWORD" https://HOSTNAME/wp-json/wp/v2/users?context=edit
    ```

## 󠀁[Authentication Plugins](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/?output_format=md#authentication-plugins)󠁿

Plugins may be added to support alternative modes of authentication that will work
from remote applications. Some example plugins are [OAuth 1.0a Server](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api-oauth1/)
and [JSON Web Tokens](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/).

There’s also a [Basic Authentication](https://github.com/WP-API/Basic-Auth) plugin.

Note that this plugin requires sending your username and password with every request,
and should only be used for development and testing i.e. not in a production environment.
Using Application Passwords (see above) is preferred.

takes arguments, describe the arguments.)_

## 󠀁[Actions Run During a Typical Request](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/hooks/action-reference/?output_format=md#actions-run-during-a-typical-request)󠁿

These actions are called when a logged-in user opens the home page, this list may
be outdated. This list may show only the first time each action is called, and in
many cases no function is hooked to the action. Themes and plugins can cause actions
to be called multiple times and at differing times during a request. As proof of
this, you can see action calls specific to the [Twenty Eleven](https://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentyeleven)
theme on this list. Cron tasks may also fire when a user visits the site, adding
additional action calls. This list should be viewed as a guide line or approximation
of WordPress action execution order, and not a concrete specification.

Actions are called with the function [`do_action()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_action/),
except those marked (ref array), which are called with the function [`do_action_ref_array()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_action_ref_array/).

## 󠀁[Actions Run During an Admin Page Request](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/hooks/action-reference/?output_format=md#actions-run-during-an-admin-page-request)󠁿

These actions are run when a logged-in user opens the [Posts](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/posts-screen/)
page. This list shows only the first time an action is called, and in many cases
no function is hooked to the action. Each admin page has a different list of actions
depending upon the purpose of the page and the plugins installed. This list should
be viewed as a guide line or approximation, and not a concrete specification.

In these actions, `(hookname)` depends on the page. For the Posts page it is _edit.
php_, or for a theme’s Background page it is `appearance_page_custom-background`.

Actions are called with the function [`do_action()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_action/),
except those marked (ref array), which are called with the function [`do_action_ref_array()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_action_ref_array/).

## 󠀁[WP_Query Filters](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/hooks/filter-reference/?output_format=md#wp_query-filters)󠁿

These are filters run by the [WP_Query object](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/)
in the course of building
and executing a query to retrieve posts. See also [#Advanced WordPress Filters](https://developer.wordpress.org/?output_format=md#Advanced_WordPress_Filters)
for queries relatingto users, meta values, and more generic queries.

[found_posts](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/found_posts/) : applied
to the list of posts, just after querying from the database.

[found_posts_query](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/found_posts_query/):
after the list of posts to display is queried from the database, WordPress selects
rows in the query results. This filter allows you to do something other than `SELECT
FOUND_ROWS()` at that step.

[post_limits](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/post_limits/) : applied
to the `LIMIT` clause of the query that returns the post array.

[posts_clauses](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/posts_clauses/) :
applied to the entire SQL query, divided into a keyed array for each clause type,
that returns the post array. Can be easier to work with than `posts_request`.

[posts_distinct](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/posts_distinct/):
allows a plugin to add a `DISTINCTROW` clause to the query that returns the post
array.

[posts_fields](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/posts_fields/) : 
applied to the field list for the query that returns the post array.

[posts_groupby](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/posts_groupby/) :
applied to the `GROUP BY` clause of the query that returns the post array (normally
empty).

[posts_join](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/posts_join/) : applied
to the `JOIN` clause of the query that returns the post array. This is typically
used to add a table to the `JOIN`, in combination with the `posts_where` filter.

[posts_join_paged](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/posts_join_paged/):
applied to the `JOIN` clause of the query that returns the post array, after the
paging is calculated (though paging does not affect the JOIN, so this is actually
equivalent to `posts_join`).

[posts_orderby](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/posts_orderby/) :
applied to the `ORDER BY` clause of the query that returns the post array.

[posts_request](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/posts_request/) :
applied to the entire SQL query that returns the post array, just prior to running
the query.

[posts_results](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/posts_results/) :
allows you to manipulate the resulting array returned from the query.

[posts_search](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/posts_search/) : 
applied to the search SQL that is used in the `WHERE` clause of [WP_Query](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/).

[posts_where](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/posts_where/) : applied
to the `WHERE` clause of the query that returns the post array.

[posts_where_paged](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/posts_where_paged/):
applied to the `WHERE` clause of the query that returns the post array, after the
paging is calculated (though paging does not affect the WHERE, so this is actually
equivalent to `posts_where`).

[the_posts](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/the_posts/) : applied
to the list of posts queried from the database after minimal processing for permissions
and draft status on single-post pages.

## 󠀁[Overview](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/options/?output_format=md#overview)󠁿

The **Options API** is a simple and standardized way of storing data in the database.
The API makes it easy to create, access, update, and delete options. All the data
is stored in the [wp_options table](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/handbook/database/)
under a given custom name.

This page contains the technical documentation needed to use the Options API. A 
list of default options can be found in the [Option Reference](https://codex.wordpress.org/Option_Reference)(
link to Codex version, waiting for content migration to HelpHub).

Note that the `_site_` functions are essentially the same as their counterparts.
The only differences occur for WP Multisite, when the options apply network-wide
and the data is stored in the [wp_sitemeta](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/handbook/database/)
table under the given custom name.

    add_option( $option, $value = , $deprecated = , $autoload = 'yes' );

    // Removes option by name.
    delete_option( $option );

    // Fetch a saved option
    get_option( $option, $default = false );

    // Update the value of an option that was already added.
    update_option( $option, $newvalue );

## 󠀁[Overview](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/settings/?output_format=md#overview)󠁿

The **Settings API**, added in [WordPress 2.7](https://developer.wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-2-7?output_format=md),
allows admin pages containing settings forms to be managed semi-automatically. It
lets you define settings pages, sections within those pages and fields within the
sections.

New settings pages can be registered along with sections and fields inside them.
Existing settings pages can also be added to by registering new settings sections
or fields inside of them.

Organizing registration and validation of fields still requires some effort from
developers using the Settings API, but avoids a lot of complex debugging of underlying
options management.

NOTE: When using the Settings API, the form posts to `wp-admin/options.php` which
provides fairly strict capabilities checking. Users will need `manage_options` capability(
and in MultiSite will have to be a Super Admin) to submit the form.

The functions are found in `[wp-admin/includes/plugin.php](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/5.2.1/src/wp-admin/includes/plugin.php#L0)`
and `[wp-admin/includes/template.php](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/5.2.1/src/wp-admin/includes/template.php#L0)`

## 󠀁[Adding Setting Fields](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/settings/?output_format=md#adding-setting-fields)󠁿

You can add new settings fields (basically, an option in the `wp_options` database
table but totally managed for you) to the existing WordPress pages using this function.
Your callback function just needs to output the appropriate HTML input and fill 
it with the old value, the saving will be done behind the scenes. You can create
your own sections on existing pages using `add_settings_section()` as described 
below.

**NOTE:** You MUST register any options you use with `add_settings_field()` or they
won’t be saved and updated automatically. See below for details and an example.

    ```php
    add_settings_field( $id, $title, $callback, $page, $section = 'default', $args = array() )
    ```

 * `$id` – String for use in the ‘id’ attribute of tags.
 * `$title` – Title of the field.
 * `$callback` – Function that fills the field with the desired inputs as part of
   the larger form. Name and id of the input should match the $id given to this 
   function. The function should echo its output.
 * `$page` – The type of settings page on which to show the field (general, reading,
   writing, …).
 * `$section` – The section of the settings page in which to show the box (default
   or a section you added with add_settings_section, look at the page in the source
   to see what the existing ones are.)
 * `$args` – Extra arguments passed into the callback function

## 󠀁[Adding Settings Sections](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/settings/?output_format=md#adding-settings-sections)󠁿

Settings Sections are the groups of settings you see on WordPress settings pages
with a shared heading. In your plugin you can add new sections to existing settings
pages rather than creating a whole new page. This makes your plugin simpler to maintain
and creates fewer new pages for users to learn. You just tell them to change your
setting on the relevant existing page.

    ```php
    add_settings_section( $id, $title, $callback, $page );
    ```

 * `$id` – String for use in the ‘id’ attribute of tags.
 * `$title` – Title of the section.
 * `$callback` – Function that fills the section with the desired content. The function
   should echo its output.
 * `$page` – The type of settings page on which to show the section (general, reading,
   writing, media etc.)

## 󠀁[Registering Settings](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/settings/?output_format=md#registering-settings)󠁿

    ```php
    register_setting( $option_group, $option_name, $args );
    ```

    ```php
    unregister_setting( $option_group, $option_name );
    ```

**NOTE:** `register_setting()` as well as the above mentioned `add_settings_*()`
functions should all be called from a `admin_init` action hook callback function.
Refer to the “Examples” section below.

## 󠀁[Options Form Rendering](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/settings/?output_format=md#options-form-rendering)󠁿

When using the API to add settings to existing options pages, you do not need to
be concerned about the form itself, as it has already been defined for the page.
When you define a new page from scratch, you need to output a minimal form structure
that contains a few tags that in turn output the actual sections and settings for
the page.

To display the hidden fields and handle security of your options form, the Settings
API provides the [settings_fields()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/settings_fields/)
function. `settings_fields( $option_group ); `

`**$option_group**`** (**_**string**_**) (**_**required**_**):**

A settings group name. This must match the group name used in [register_setting()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_setting/),
which is the page slug name on which the form is to appear. Default: _None_

To display the sections assigned to the page and the settings contained within, 
the Settings API provides the [do_settings_sections()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_settings_sections/)
function. ` do_settings_sections( $page ); `

`**$page**`** (**_**string**_**) (**_**required**_**):**

The slug name of the page whose settings sections you want to output. This should
match the page name used in [add_settings_section()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_settings_section/).
Default: _None_

The [do_settings_fields()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_settings_fields/)
function is provided to output the fields assigned to a particular page and section.
You should not call this function directly, rather use `do_settings_sections()` 
to output the Section content as well as the associated fields.

Your options form also needs a submit button. You can use the [submit_button()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/submit_button/)
function to do this.

Finally, you need to output the HTML <form> tag defining the action destination 
of options.php and method of POST. Here is an example options form code to generate
all the sections and fields added to a page who’s slug name is `my-page`:

    ```php
    <form method="POST" action="options.php">
    <?php 
    settings_fields( 'my-page' ); // pass slug name of page, also referred to in Settings API as option group name
    do_settings_sections( 'my-page' );  // pass slug name of page
    submit_button(); // submit button
    ?>
    </form>
    ```

     } // wporg_settings_api_init()

     add_action( 'admin_init', 'wporg_settings_api_init' );


    /**

     *
     * This function is needed if we added a new section. This function 
     * will be run at the start of our section
     */

     function wporg_setting_section_callback_function() {
     	echo '<p>Intro text for our settings section</p>';
     }

    /*
     * Callback function for our example setting
     *
     * creates a checkbox true/false option. Other types are surely possible
     */

     function wporg_setting_callback_function() {
     	echo '<input name="wporg_setting_name" id="wporg_setting_name" type="checkbox" value="1" class="code" ' . checked( 1, get_option( 'wporg_setting_name' ), false ) . ' /> <label for="wporg_setting_name">Explanation text</label>';
     }

Welcome to the **WordPress Advanced Administration Handbook**! Here you will find
WordPress advanced documentation. Use the “Contents” menu on the left to navigate
topics.

## 󠀁[Why Advanced Administration?](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/?output_format=md#why-advanced-administration)󠁿

Not all users who use WordPress have to know about technology, and therefore in 
its documentation should not appear either, and developers do not have to know certain
advanced system configurations.

With this in mind, all the more technically complex documentation has been included
in this documentation so that it can be used by more or less technical people.

## 󠀁[Where can I be involved?](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/?output_format=md#where-can-i-be-involved)󠁿

The Documentation Team meets in the WordPress Slack, in the [#docs](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/docs/)
channel. The conversations are in English. Check out the [WordPress Meeting calendar](https://make.wordpress.org/meetings#docs)
for the current schedule.

# Before You Install

## In this article

 * [Requirements on the server side](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/?output_format=md#requirements-on-the-server-side)
 * [Requirements on local](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/?output_format=md#requirements-on-local)


Before installing WordPress, you need to check that your web hosting provider fulfills
the necessary software and conditions. Also, you must have access to the server 
and some tools.

If these terms are new to you: your **host** (or **hosting provider**) is the company
you pay to put your site online, and the **server** is the computer where WordPress
runs.

## 󠀁[Requirements on the server side](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/?output_format=md#requirements-on-the-server-side)󠁿

 * PHP 7.4 or greater
 * MySQL 5.7 or MariaDB 10.3 or greater
 * HTTPS support

For a list of detail requirements on your web host, refer the [official requirement page](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/)
and the [Server Environment page](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/server-environment/).

## 󠀁[Requirements on local](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/?output_format=md#requirements-on-local)󠁿

 * Login Account (user id and password) to the server via FTP or shell
 * Text Editor
 * FTP
 * Your web browser of choice

You will need to know how to use a text editor to edit the main configuration file.
If you are a Windows user, Notepad will do. If you’re an OS X user you can use TextEdit.
Later, you will likely want to edit your Template Files (see [Templates](https://codex.wordpress.org/Templates)
for some references). You can do this through the WordPress [Administration Screens](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administration-screens/),
but using a good text editor is highly recommended. For more information on this,
see [Editing files](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/edit-files/).

You will need to be able to use an FTP program to [upload](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/upgrade/ftp/filezilla/)
files and [set file permissions](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/server/file-permissions/)(
optional). You could choose [FileZilla](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/upgrade/ftp/filezilla/)
for this task.

Now you are all set to go on to [Installation](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/howto-install/).

# Debugging WordPress

## In this article

 * [General WordPress Debugging](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/?output_format=md#general-wordpress-debugging)
 * [JavaScript Debugging](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/?output_format=md#javascript-debugging)
 * [WordPress Network Debugging](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/?output_format=md#wordpress-network-debugging)
 * [Test-driving](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/?output_format=md#test-driving)


Debugging is an essential part of website development and a crucial step in ensuring
a smooth and reliable experience for users. Debugging refers to the process of finding
and fixing errors or issues within a website’s code.

In this part of the Advanced Administration Handbook, we will address various aspects
of debugging a WordPress website, including general WordPress debugging, JavaScript
debugging, WordPress network debugging, and test-driving.

## 󠀁[General WordPress Debugging](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/?output_format=md#general-wordpress-debugging)󠁿

When it comes to [debugging a WordPress site](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/debug-wordpress/),
there are various methods and techniques to use, including turning on debugging 
in the WordPress configuration file, using error logs and the use of debugging plugins.
These techniques can help identify and resolve various types of errors, such as 
PHP errors and database errors.

## 󠀁[JavaScript Debugging](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/?output_format=md#javascript-debugging)󠁿

[JavaScript debugging](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/debug-javascript/)
is essential for ensuring that the site’s front-end interactions and user experience
are functioning correctly. Using browser dev tools to inspect the source code and
diagnose issues with JavaScript along with a few more tips are provided in this 
section.

## 󠀁[WordPress Network Debugging](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/?output_format=md#wordpress-network-debugging)󠁿

[WordPress network debugging](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/debug-network/)
is a required when maintaining a network of WordPress sites; referring to the process
of debugging multiple sites that are connected through a single installation of 
WordPress. This type of setup is often used by organizations that have multiple 
websites that share a common set of plugins, themes, and users.

## 󠀁[Test-driving](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/?output_format=md#test-driving)󠁿

[Test-driving](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/debug/test-driving/)
refers to the process of testing a website before making it live. This process allows
developers to identify and resolve any issues or bugs before the site is made available
to the public. Test-driving is typically performed in a sandbox environment. Creating
a sandbox environment is covered in this section.

These PHP coding standards are intended for the WordPress community as a whole. 
They are mandatory for WordPress Core and we encourage you to use them for your 
themes and plugins as well.

While themes and plugins may choose to follow a different _coding style_, these **
_coding standards_** are not just about _code style_, but also encompass established
best practices regarding interoperability, translatability, and security in the 
WordPress ecosystem, so, even when using a different _code style_, we recommend 
you still adhere to the WordPress Coding Standards in regard to these best practices.

While not all code may fully comply with these standards (yet), all newly committed
and/or updated code should fully comply with these coding standards.

Also see the [PHP Inline Documentation Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/inline-documentation-standards/php/)
for further guidelines.

If you want to automatically check your code against this standard, you can use 
the official [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards)
tooling, which is run using [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/).

## 󠀁[General](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#general)󠁿

### 󠀁[Opening and Closing PHP Tags](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#opening-and-closing-php-tags)󠁿

When embedding multi-line PHP snippets within an HTML block, the PHP open and close
tags must be on a line by themselves.

Correct (Multiline):

    ```php
    function foo() {
        ?>
        <div>
            <?php
            echo esc_html(
                bar(
                    $baz,
                    $bat
                )
            );
            ?>
        </div>
        <?php
    }
    ```

Correct (Single Line):

    ```php
    <input name="<?php echo esc_attr( $name ); ?>" />
    ```

Incorrect:

    ```php
    if ( $a === $b ) { ?>
    <some html>
    <?php }
    ```

### 󠀁[No Shorthand PHP Tags](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#no-shorthand-php-tags)󠁿

**Important:** Never use shorthand PHP start tags. Always use full PHP tags.

Correct:

    ```php
    <?php ... ?>
    <?php echo esc_html( $var ); ?>
    ```

Incorrect:

    ```php
    <? ... ?>
    <?= esc_html( $var ) ?>
    ```

### 󠀁[Single and Double Quotes](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#single-and-double-quotes)󠁿

Use single and double quotes when appropriate. If you’re not evaluating anything
in the string, use single quotes. You should almost never have to escape quotes 
in a string, because you can just alternate your quoting style, like so:

    ```php
    echo '<a href="/static/link" class="button button-primary">Link name</a>';
    echo "<a href='{$escaped_link}'>text with a ' single quote</a>";
    ```

Text that goes into HTML or XML attributes should be escaped so that single or double
quotes do not end the attribute value and invalidate the HTML, causing a security
issue. See [Data Validation](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/data-validation/)
in the Plugin Handbook for further details.

### 󠀁[Writing require/include statements](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#writing-require-include-statements)󠁿

Because `require[_once]` and `include[_once]` are language constructs, they do not
need parentheses around the path, so those shouldn’t be used. There should only 
be one space between the path and the require/include keywords.

It is _strongly recommended_ to use `require[_once]` for unconditional includes.
When using `include[_once]`, PHP will throw a warning when the file is not found
but will continue execution, which will almost certainly lead to other errors/warnings/
notices being thrown if your application depends on the file loaded, potentially
leading to security leaks. For that reason, `require[_once]` is generally the better
choice as it will throw a `Fatal Error` if the file cannot be found.

    ```php
    // Correct.
    require_once ABSPATH . 'file-name.php';

    // Incorrect.
    include_once  ( ABSPATH . 'file-name.php' );
    require_once     __DIR__ . '/file-name.php';
    ```

## 󠀁[Naming](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#naming)󠁿

### 󠀁[Naming Conventions](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#naming-conventions)󠁿

Use lowercase letters in variable, action/filter, and function names (never `camelCase`).
Separate words via underscores. Don’t abbreviate variable names unnecessarily; let
the code be unambiguous and self-documenting.

    ```php
    function some_name( $some_variable ) {}
    ```

For function parameter names, it is _strongly recommended_ to avoid reserved keywords
as names, as it leads to hard to read and confusing code when using the PHP 8.0 “
named parameters in function calls” feature.
 Also keep in mind that renaming a 
function parameter should be considered a breaking change since PHP 8.0, so name
function parameters with due care!

Class, trait, interface and enum names should use capitalized words separated by
underscores. Any acronyms should be all upper case.

    ```php
    class Walker_Category extends Walker {}
    class WP_HTTP {}

    interface Mailer_Interface {}
    trait Forbid_Dynamic_Properties {}
    enum Post_Status {}
    ```

Constants should be in all upper-case with underscores separating words:

    ```php
    define( 'DOING_AJAX', true );
    ```

Files should be named descriptively using lowercase letters. Hyphens should separate
words.

    ```php
    my-plugin-name.php
    ```

Class file names should be based on the class name with `class-` prepended and the
underscores in the class name replaced with hyphens, for example, `WP_Error` becomes:

    ```php
    class-wp-error.php
    ```

This file-naming standard is for all current and new files with classes, except 
test classes.
 For files containing test classes, the file name should reflect the
class name exactly, as per PSR4. This is to ensure cross-version [compatibility with all supported PHPUnit versions](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/pull/4109).

Files containing template tags in the `wp-includes` directory should have `-template`
appended to the end of the name so that they are obvious.

    ```php
    general-template.php
    ```

### 󠀁[Interpolation for Naming Dynamic Hooks](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#interpolation-for-naming-dynamic-hooks)󠁿

Dynamic hooks should be named using interpolation rather than concatenation for 
readability and discoverability purposes.

Dynamic hooks are hooks that include dynamic values in their tag name, e.g. `{$new_status}_{
$post->post_type}` (publish_post).

Variables used in hook tags should be wrapped in curly braces `{` and `}`, with 
the complete outer tag name wrapped in double quotes. This is to ensure PHP can 
correctly parse the given variables’ types within the interpolated string.

    ```php
    do_action( "{$new_status}_{$post->post_type}", $post->ID, $post );
    ```

Where possible, dynamic values in tag names should also be as succinct and to the
point as possible. `$user_id` is much more self-documenting than, say, `$this->id`.

## 󠀁[Whitespace](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#whitespace)󠁿

### 󠀁[Space Usage](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#space-usage)󠁿

Always put spaces after commas, and on both sides of logical, arithmetic, comparison,
string and assignment operators.

    ```php
    SOME_CONST === 23;
    foo() && bar();
    ! $foo;
    array( 1, 2, 3 );
    $baz . '-5';
    $term .= 'X';
    if ( $object instanceof Post_Type_Interface ) {}
    $result = 2 ** 3; // 8.
    ```

Put spaces on both sides of the opening and closing parentheses of control structure
blocks.

    ```php
    foreach ( $foo as $bar ) { ...
    ```

When defining a function, do it like so:

    ```php
    function my_function( $param1 = 'foo', $param2 = 'bar' ) { ...

    function my_other_function() { ...
    ```

When calling a function, do it like so:

    ```php
    my_function( $param1, func_param( $param2 ) );
    my_other_function();
    ```

When performing logical comparisons, do it like so:

    ```php
    if ( ! $foo ) { ...
    ```

[Type casts](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php#language.types.typecasting)
must be lowercase. Always prefer the short, canonical form of type casts, `(int)`
instead of `(integer)` and `(bool)` rather than `(boolean)`. For float casts use`(
float)`.

    ```php
    $foo = (bool) $bar; // Correct.
    $foo = (boolean) $bar; // Incorrect.
    ```

When referring to array items, only include a space around the index if it is a 
variable, for example:

    ```php
    $x = $foo['bar']; // Correct.
    $x = $foo[ 'bar' ]; // Incorrect.

    $x = $foo[0]; // Correct.
    $x = $foo[ 0 ]; // Incorrect.

    $x = $foo[ $bar ]; // Correct.
    $x = $foo[$bar]; // Incorrect.
    ```

In a `switch` block, there must be no space between the `case` condition and the
colon.

    ```php
    switch ( $foo ) {
        case 'bar': // Correct.
        case 'bar' : // Incorrect.
    }
    ```

Unless otherwise specified, parentheses should have spaces inside them.

    ```php
    if ( $foo && ( $bar || $baz ) ) { ...

    my_function( ( $x - 1 ) * 5, $y );
    ```

When using increment (`++`) or decrement (`--`) operators, there should be no spaces
between the operator and the variable it applies to.

    ```php
    // Correct.
    for ( $i = 0; $i < 10; $i++ ) {}

    // Incorrect.
    for ( $i = 0; $i < 10; $i ++ ) {}
    ++   $b; // Multiple spaces.
    ```

### 󠀁[Indentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#indentation)󠁿

Your indentation should always reflect logical structure. Use **real tabs**, **not
spaces**, as this allows the most flexibility across clients.

Exception: if you have a block of code that would be more readable if things are
aligned, use spaces:

    ```php
    [tab]$foo   = 'somevalue';
    [tab]$foo2  = 'somevalue2';
    [tab]$foo34 = 'somevalue3';
    [tab]$foo5  = 'somevalue4';
    ```

For arrays with explicit keys, _each item_ should start on a new line when the array
contains more than one item:

    ```php
    $query = new WP_Query( array( 'ID' => 123 ) );
    ```

    ```php
    $args = array(
    [tab]'post_type'   => 'page',
    [tab]'post_author' => 123,
    [tab]'post_status' => 'publish',
    );

    $query = new WP_Query( $args );
    ```

Note the comma after the last array item: this is recommended because it makes it
easier to change the order of the array, and makes for cleaner diffs when new items
are added.

    ```php
    $my_array = array(
    [tab]'foo'   => 'somevalue',
    [tab]'foo2'  => 'somevalue2',
    [tab]'foo3'  => 'somevalue3',
    [tab]'foo34' => 'somevalue3',
    );
    ```

For `switch` control structures, `case` statements should be indented one tab from
the `switch` statement and the contents of the `case` should be indented one tab
from the `case` condition statement.

    ```php
    switch ( $type ) {
    [tab]case 'foo':
    [tab][tab]some_function();
    [tab][tab]break;
    [tab]case 'bar':
    [tab][tab]some_function();
    [tab][tab]break;
    }
    ```

**Rule of thumb:** Tabs should be used at the beginning of the line for indentation,
while spaces can be used mid-line for alignment.

### 󠀁[Remove Trailing Spaces](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#remove-trailing-spaces)󠁿

Remove trailing whitespace at the end of each line. Omitting the closing PHP tag
at the end of a file is preferred. If you use the tag, make sure you remove trailing
whitespace.

There should be no trailing blank lines at the end of a function body.

## 󠀁[Formatting](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#formatting)󠁿

### 󠀁[Brace Style](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#brace-style)󠁿

Braces shall be used for all blocks in the style shown here:

    ```php
    if ( condition ) {
        action1();
        action2();
    } elseif ( condition2 && condition3 ) {
        action3();
        action4();
    } else {
        defaultaction();
    }
    ```

If you have a really long block, consider whether it can be broken into two or more
shorter blocks, functions, or methods, to reduce complexity, improve ease of testing,
and increase readability.

Braces should always be used, even when they are not required:

    ```php
    if ( condition ) {
        action0();
    }

    if ( condition ) {
        action1();
    } elseif ( condition2 ) {
        action2a();
        action2b();
    }

    foreach ( $items as $item ) {
        process_item( $item );
    }
    ```

Note that requiring the use of braces means that _single-statement inline control
structures_ are prohibited. You are free to use the [alternative syntax for control structures](https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.alternative-syntax.php)(
e.g. `if`/`endif`, `while`/`endwhile`)—especially in templates where PHP code is
embedded within HTML, for instance:

    ```php
    <?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>
        <div class="hfeed">
            <?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
                <article id="<?php echo esc_attr( 'post-' . get_the_ID() ); ?>" class="<?php echo esc_attr( get_post_class() ); ?>">
                    <!-- ... -->
                </article>
            <?php endwhile; ?>
        </div>
    <?php endif; ?>
    ```

### 󠀁[Declaring Arrays](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#declaring-arrays)󠁿

Using long array syntax ( `array( 1, 2, 3 )` ) for declaring arrays is generally
more readable than short array syntax ( `[ 1, 2, 3 ]` ), particularly for those 
with vision difficulties. Additionally, it’s much more descriptive for beginners.

Arrays must be declared using long array syntax.

### 󠀁[Multiline Function Calls](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#multiline-function-calls)󠁿

When splitting a function call over multiple lines, each parameter must be on a 
separate line. Single line inline comments can take up their own line.

Each parameter must take up no more than a single line. Multi-line parameter values
must be assigned to a variable and then that variable should be passed to the function
call.

    ```php
    $bar = array(
        'use_this' => true,
        'meta_key' => 'field_name',
    );
    $baz = sprintf(
        /* translators: %s: Friend's name */
        __( 'Hello, %s!', 'yourtextdomain' ),
        $friend_name
    );

    $a = foo(
        $bar,
        $baz,
        /* translators: %s: cat */
        sprintf( __( 'The best pet is a %s.' ), 'cat' )
    );
    ```

### 󠀁[Type declarations](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#type-declarations)󠁿

Type declarations must have exactly one space before and after the type. The nullability
operator (`?`) is regarded as part of the type declaration and there should be no
space between this operator and the actual type. Class/interface/enum name based
type declarations should use the case of the class/interface/enum name as declared,
while the keyword-based type declarations should be lowercased.

Return type declarations should have no space between the closing parenthesis of
the function declaration and the colon starting a return type.

These rules apply to all structures allowing for type declarations: functions, closures,
enums, catch conditions as well as the PHP 7.4 arrow functions and typed properties.

    ```php
    // Correct.
    function foo( Class_Name $parameter, callable $callable, int $number_of_things = 0 ) {
        // Do something.
    }

    function bar(
        Interface_Name&Concrete_Class $param_a,
        string|int $param_b,
        callable $param_c = 'default_callable'
    ): User|false {
        // Do something.
    }

    // Incorrect.
    function baz(Class_Name $param_a, String$param_b,      CALLABLE     $param_c )   :   ?   iterable   {
        // Do something.
    }
    ```

 Type declaration usage has the following restrictions based on the minimum required
PHP version of an application, whether it is WordPress Core, a plugin or a theme:

 * The scalar `bool`, `int`, `float`, and `string` type declarations cannot be used
   until the minimum PHP version is PHP 7.0 or higher.
 * Return type declarations cannot be used until the minimum PHP version is PHP 
   7.0 or higher.
 * Nullable type declarations cannot be used until the minimum PHP version is PHP
   7.1 or higher.
 * The `iterable` and `void` type declarations cannot be used until the minimum 
   PHP version is PHP 7.1 or higher. The `void` type can only be used as a return
   type.
 * The `object` type declaration cannot be used until the minimum PHP version is
   PHP 7.2 or higher.
 * Property type declarations cannot be used until the minimum PHP version is PHP
   7.4 or higher.
 * `static` (return type only) cannot be used until the minimum PHP version is PHP
   8.0 or higher.
 * `mixed` type cannot be used until the minimum PHP version is PHP 8.0 or higher.
   Take note that the `mixed` type includes `null`, so cannot be made nullable.
 * Union types cannot be used until the minimum PHP version is PHP 8.0 or higher.
 * Intersection types cannot be used until the minimum PHP version is PHP 8.1 or
   higher.
 * `never` (return type only) cannot be used until the minimum PHP version is PHP
   8.1 or higher.
 * Disjunctive normal form types (combining union types and intersection types) 
   cannot be used until the minimum PHP version is PHP 8.2 or higher.

_Usage in WordPress Core_

 Adding type declarations to existing WordPress Core functions should be done with
extreme care.

The function signature of any function (method) which can be overloaded by plugins
or themes should not be touched.
 This leaves, for now, only unconditionally declared
functions in the global namespace, `private` class methods, and code new to Core,
as candidates for adding type declarations.

Note: Using the `array` keyword in type declarations is **strongly discouraged**
for now, as most often, it would be better to use `iterable` to allow for more flexibility
in the implementation and that keyword is not yet available for use in WordPress
Core until the minimum requirements are raised to PHP 7.1.

### 󠀁[Magic constants](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#magic-constants)󠁿

The [PHP native `__*__` magic constants](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.magic.php),
like `__CLASS__` and `__DIR__`, should be written in uppercase when used.

When using the `::class` constant for class name resolution, the `class` keyword
should be in lowercase and there should be no spaces around the `::` operator.

    ```php
    // Correct.
    add_action( 'action_name', array( __CLASS__, 'method_name' ) );
    add_action( 'action_name', array( My_Class::class, 'method_name' ) );

    // Incorrect.
    require_once __dIr__ . '/relative-path/file-name.php';
    add_action( 'action_name', array( My_Class :: CLASS, 'method_name' ) );
    ```

### 󠀁[Spread operator …](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#spread-operator)󠁿

When using the spread operator, there should be one space or a new line with the
appropriate indentation before the spread operator. There should be no spaces between
the spread operator and the variable/function call it applies to. When combining
the spread operator with the reference operator (`&`), there should be no spaces
between them.

    ```php
    // Correct.
    function foo( &...$spread ) {
        bar( ...$spread );

        bar(
            array( ...$foo ),
            ...array_values( $keyed_array )
        );
    }

    // Incorrect.
    function fool( &   ... $spread ) {
        bar(...
                 $spread );

        bar(
            [...  $foo ],... array_values( $keyed_array )
        );
    }
    ```

 The spread operator (or splat operator as it’s known in other languages) can be
used for packing arguments in function declarations (variadic functions) and unpacking
them in function calls as of PHP 5.6. Since PHP 7.4, the spread operator is also
used for unpacking numerically-indexed arrays, with string-keyed array unpacking
available since PHP 8.1. When used in a function declaration, the spread operator
can only be used with the last parameter.

## 󠀁[Declare Statements, Namespace, and Import Statements](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#declare-statements-namespace-and-import-statements)󠁿

### 󠀁[Namespace declarations](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#namespace-declarations)󠁿

Each part of a namespace name should consist of capitalized words separated by underscores.

Namespace declarations should have exactly one blank line before the declaration
and at least one blank line after.

    ```php
    namespace Prefix\Admin\Domain_URL\Sub_Domain\Event; // Correct.
    ```

There should be only one namespace declaration per file, and it should be at the
top of the file. Namespace declarations using curly brace syntax are not allowed.
Explicit global namespace declaration (namespace declaration without name) are also
not allowed.

    ```php
    // Incorrect: namespace declaration using curly brace syntax.
    namespace Foo {
        // Code.
    }

    // Incorrect: namespace declaration for the global namespace.
    namespace {
        // Code.
    }
    ```

_There is currently no timeline for introducing namespaces to WordPress Core._

The use of namespaces in plugins and themes is strongly encouraged. It is a great
way to prefix a lot of your code to prevent naming conflicts with other plugins,
themes and/or WordPress Core.

Please do make sure you use a unique and long enough namespace prefix to actually
prevent conflicts. Generally speaking, using a namespace prefix along the lines 
of `Vendor\Project_Name` is a good idea.

 The `wp` and `WordPress` namespace prefixes are reserved for WordPress itself.

 Namespacing has no effect on variables, constants declared with `define()` or 
non-PHP native constructs, like the hook names as used in WordPress. Those still
need to be prefixed individually.

### 󠀁[Using import use statements](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#using-import-use-statements)󠁿

Using import `use` statements allows you to refer to constants, functions, classes,
interfaces, namespaces, enums and traits that live outside of the current namespace.

Import `use` statements should be at the top of the file and follow the (optional)`
namespace` declaration. They should follow a specific order based on the **type**
of the import:

 1. `use` statements for namespaces, classes, interfaces, traits and enums
 2. `use` statements for functions
 3. `use` statements for constants

Aliases can be used to prevent name collisions (two classes in different namespaces
using the same class name).
 When using aliases, make sure the aliases follow the
WordPress naming convention and are unique.

The following examples showcase the correct and incorrect usage of import `use` 
statements regarding things like spacing, groupings, leading backslashes, etc.

Correct:

    ```php
    namespace Project_Name\Feature;

    use Project_Name\Sub_Feature\Class_A;
    use Project_Name\Sub_Feature\Class_C as Aliased_Class_C;
    use Project_Name\Sub_Feature\{
        Class_D,
        Class_E as Aliased_Class_E,
    }

    use function Project_Name\Sub_Feature\function_a;
    use function Project_Name\Sub_Feature\function_b as aliased_function;

    use const Project_Name\Sub_Feature\CONSTANT_A;
    use const Project_Name\Sub_Feature\CONSTANT_D as ALIASED_CONSTANT;

    // Rest of the code.
    ```

Incorrect:

    ```php
    namespace Project_Name\Feature;

    use   const   Project_Name\Sub_Feature\CONSTANT_A; // Superfluous whitespace after the "use" and the "const" keywords.
    use function Project_Name\Sub_Feature\function_a; // Function import after constant import.
    use \Project_Name\Sub_Feature\Class_C as aliased_class_c; // Leading backslash shouldn't be used, alias doesn't comply with naming conventions.
    use Project_Name\Sub_Feature\{Class_D, Class_E   as   Aliased_Class_E} // Extra spaces around the "as" keyword, incorrect whitespace use inside the brace opener and closer.
    use Vendor\Package\{ function function_a, function function_b,
         Class_C,
            const CONSTANT_NAME}; // Combining different types of imports in one use statement, incorrect whitespace use within group use statement.

    class Foo {
        // Code.
    }

    use const \Project_Name\Sub_Feature\CONSTANT_D as Aliased_constant; // Import after class definition, leading backslash, naming conventions violation.
    use function Project_Name\Sub_Feature\function_b as Aliased_Function; // Import after class definition, naming conventions violation.

    // Rest of the code.
    ```

 Import `use` statements have no effect on dynamic class, function or constant 
names. Group `use` statements are available from PHP 7.0, and trailing commas in
group `use` statements are available from PHP 7.2.

 Note that, unless you have implemented [autoloading](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php),
the `use` statement won’t automatically load whatever is being imported. For OO 
constructs, you’ll either need to set up autoloading or load the file(s) containing
the OO declaration(s) using `require[_once]` or `include[_once]` statement(s). Autoloading
is only applicable to OO constructs; for functions and constants, you must always
use `require[_once]` or `include[_once]`.

**Note about WordPress Core usage**

While import `use` statements can already be used in WordPress Core, it is, for 
the moment, **strongly discouraged**.

Import `use` statements are most useful when combined with namespaces and a class
autoloading implementation.
 As neither of these are currently in place for WordPress
Core and discussions about this are ongoing, holding off on adding import `use` 
statements to WordPress Core is the sensible choice for now.

## 󠀁[Object-Oriented Programming](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#object-oriented-programming)󠁿

### 󠀁[Only One Object Structure (Class/Interface/Trait/Enum) per File](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#only-one-object-structure-class-interface-trait-enum-per-file)󠁿

For instance, if we have a file called `class-example-class.php` it can only contain
one class in that file.

    ```php
    // Incorrect: file class-example-class.php.
    class Example_Class {}

    class Example_Class_Extended {}
    ```

The second class should be in its own file called `class-example-class-extended.
php`.

    ```php
    // Correct: file class-example-class.php.
    class Example_Class {}
    ```

    ```php
    // Correct: file class-example-class-extended.php.
    class Example_Class_Extended {}
    ```

### 󠀁[Trait Use Statements](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#trait-use-statements)󠁿

Trait `use` statements should be at the top of a class and should have exactly one
blank line before the first `use` statement, and at least one blank line after the
last statement. The only exception is when the class only contains trait `use` statements,
in which case the blank line after may be omitted.

The following code examples show the formatting requirements for trait `use` statements
regarding things like spacing, grouping and indentation.

    ```php
    // Correct.
    class Foo {

        use Bar_Trait;
        use Foo_Trait,
            Bazinga_Trait {
            Bar_Trait::method_name insteadof Bar_Trait;
            Bazinga_Trait::method_name as bazinga_method;
        }
        use Loopy_Trait {
            eat as protected;
        }

        public $baz = true;

        ...
    }

    // Incorrect.
    class Foo {
        // No blank line before trait use statement, multiple spaces after the use keyword.
        use       Bar_Trait;

        /*
         * Multiple spaces when importing traits, no new line after opening brace.
         * Aliasing should be done on the same line as the method it's replacing.
         */
        use Foo_Trait,   Bazinga_Trait{Bar_Trait::method_name    insteadof     Foo_Trait; Bazinga_Trait::method_name
            as     bazinga_method;
                }; // Wrongly indented brace.
        public $baz = true; // Missing blank line after trait import.

        ...
    }
    ```

### 󠀁[Visibility should always be declared](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#visibility-should-always-be-declared)󠁿

For all constructs that allow it (properties, methods, class constants since PHP
7.1), visibility should be explicitly declared.
 Using the `var` keyword for property
declarations is not allowed.

    ```php
    // Correct.
    class Foo {
        public $foo;

        protected function bar() {}
    }

    // Incorrect.
    class Foo {
        var $foo;

        function bar() {}
    }
    ```

_Usage in WordPress Core_

Visibility for class constants can not be used in WordPress Core until the minimum
PHP version has been raised to PHP 7.1.

### 󠀁[Visibility and modifier order](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#visibility-and-modifier-order)󠁿

When using multiple modifiers for a _class declaration_, the order should be as 
follows:

 1. First the optional `abstract` or `final` modifier.
 2. Next, the optional `readonly` modifier.

When using multiple modifiers for a _constant declaration_ inside object-oriented
structures, the order should be as follows:

 1. First the optional `final` modifier.
 2. Next, the visibility modifier.

When using multiple modifiers for a _property declaration_, the order should be 
as follows:

 1. First a visibility modifier.
 2. Next, the optional `static` or `readonly` modifier (these keywords are mutually
    exclusive).
 3. Finally, the optional `type` declaration.

When using multiple modifiers for a _method declaration_, the order should be as
follows:

 1. First the optional `abstract` or `final` modifier.
 2. Then, a visibility modifier.
 3. Finally, the optional `static` modifier.

    ```php
    // Correct.
    abstract readonly class Foo {
        private const LABEL = 'Book';

        public static $foo;

        private readonly string $bar;

        abstract protected static function bar();
    }

    // Incorrect.
    class Foo {
        protected final const SLUG = 'book';

        static public $foo;

        static protected final function bar() {
            // Code.
        };
    }
    ```

 – Visibility for OO constants can be declared since PHP 7.1. – Typed properties
are available since PHP 7.4. – Readonly properties are available since PHP 8.1. –`
final` modifier for constants in object-oriented structures is available since PHP
8.1. – Readonly classes are available since PHP 8.2.

### 󠀁[Object Instantiation](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#object-instantiation)󠁿

When instantiating a new object instance, parenthesis must always be used, even 
when not strictly necessary.
 There should be no space between the name of the class
being instantiated and the opening parenthesis.

    ```php
    // Correct.
    $foo = new Foo();
    $anonymous_class = new class( $parameter ) { ... };
    $instance = new static();

    // Incorrect.
    $foo = new Foo;
    $anonymous_class = new class ( $input ) { ... };
    ```

## 󠀁[Control Structures](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#control-structures)󠁿

### 󠀁[Use elseif, not else if](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#use-elseif-not-else-if)󠁿

`else if` is not compatible with the colon syntax for `if|elseif` blocks. For this
reason, use `elseif` for conditionals.

### 󠀁[Yoda Conditions](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#yoda-conditions)󠁿

    ```php
    if ( true === $the_force ) {
        $victorious = you_will( $be );
    }
    ```

When doing logical comparisons involving variables, always put the variable on the
right side and put constants, literals, or function calls on the left side. If neither
side is a variable, the order is not important. (In [computer science terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)#Assignment:_l-values_and_r-values),
in comparisons always try to put l-values on the right and r-values on the left.)

In the above example, if you omit an equals sign (admit it, it happens even to the
most seasoned of us), you’ll get a parse error, because you can’t assign to a constant
like `true`. If the statement were the other way around `( $the_force = true )`,
the assignment would be perfectly valid, returning `1`, causing the if statement
to evaluate to `true`, and you could be chasing that bug for a while.

A little bizarre, it is, to read. Get used to it, you will.

This applies to `==`, `!=`, `===`, and `!==`. Yoda conditions for `<`, `>`, `<=`
or `>=` are significantly more difficult to read and are best avoided.

## 󠀁[Operators](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#operators)󠁿

### 󠀁[Ternary Operator](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#ternary-operator)󠁿

[Ternary operators](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php#language.operators.comparison.ternary)
are fine, but always have them test if the statement is true, not false. Otherwise,
it just gets confusing. (An exception would be using `! empty()`, as testing for
false here is generally more intuitive.)

The short ternary operator must not be used.

For example:

    ```php
    // (if statement is true) ? (do this) : (else, do this);
    $musictype = ( 'jazz' === $music ) ? 'cool' : 'blah';
    // (if field is not empty ) ? (do this) : (else, do this);
    ```

### 󠀁[Error Control Operator @](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#error-control-operator)󠁿

As noted in the [PHP docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.errorcontrol.php):

>  PHP supports one error control operator: the at sign (@). When prepended to an
> expression in PHP, any diagnostic error that might be generated by that expression
> will be suppressed.

While this operator does exist in Core, it is often used lazily instead of doing
proper error checking. Its use is highly discouraged, as even the PHP docs also 
state:

>  Warning: Prior to PHP 8.0.0, it was possible for the @ operator to disable critical
> errors that will terminate script execution. For example, prepending @ to a call
> of a function that did not exist, by being unavailable or mistyped, would cause
> the script to terminate with no indication as to why.

### 󠀁[Increment/decrement operators](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#increment-decrement-operators)󠁿

Pre-increment/decrement should be favored over post-increment/decrement for stand-
alone statements.

Pre-increment/decrement will increment/decrement and then return, while post-increment/
decrement will return and then increment/decrement.
 Using the “pre” version is 
slightly more performant and can prevent future bugs when code gets moved around.

    ```php
    // Correct: Pre-decrement.
    --$a;

    // Incorrect: Post-decrement.
    $a--;
    ```

## 󠀁[Database](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#database)󠁿

### 󠀁[Database Queries](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#database-queries)󠁿

Avoid touching the database directly. If there is a defined function that can get
the data you need, use it. Database abstraction (using functions instead of queries)
helps keep your code forward-compatible and, in cases where results are cached in
memory, it can be many times faster.

If you must touch the database, consider creating a [Trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/)
ticket. There you can discuss the possibility of adding a new function to cover 
the functionality you wanted, for a future version of WordPress.

### 󠀁[Formatting SQL statements](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#formatting-sql-statements)󠁿

When formatting SQL statements you may break them into several lines and indent 
if it is sufficiently complex to warrant it. Most statements work well as one line
though. Always capitalize the SQL parts of the statement like `UPDATE` or `WHERE`.

Functions that update the database should expect their parameters to lack SQL slash
escaping when passed. Escaping should be done as close to the time of the query 
as possible, preferably by using `$wpdb->prepare()`

`$wpdb->prepare()` is a method that handles escaping, quoting, and int-casting for
SQL queries. It uses a subset of the `sprintf()` style of formatting. Example :

    ```php
    $var = "dangerous'"; // Raw data that may or may not need to be escaped.
    $id = some_foo_number(); // Data we expect to be an integer, but we're not certain.

    $wpdb->query( $wpdb->prepare( "UPDATE $wpdb->posts SET post_title = %s WHERE ID = %d", $var, $id ) );
    ```

The following placeholders can be used in the query string:

 * %d (integer)
 * %f (float)
 * %s (string)
 * %i (identifier, e.g. table/field names)

Note that these placeholders should not be ‘quoted’! `$wpdb->prepare()` will take
care of escaping and quoting for us. This makes it easy to see at a glance whether
something has been escaped or not because it happens right when the query happens.

See [Data Validation](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/data-validation/)
in the Plugin Handbook for further details.

## 󠀁[Recommendations](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#recommendations)󠁿

### 󠀁[Self-Explanatory Flag Values for Function Arguments](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#self-explanatory-flag-values-for-function-arguments)󠁿

Prefer string values to just `true` and `false` when calling functions.

    ```php
    // Incorrect.
    function eat( $what, $slowly = true ) {
    ...
    }
    eat( 'mushrooms' );
    eat( 'mushrooms', true ); // What does true mean?
    eat( 'dogfood', false ); // What does false mean? The opposite of true?
    ```

PHP only supports named arguments as of PHP 8.0. However, as WordPress currently
still supports older PHP versions, we cannot yet use those.
 Without named arguments,
the values of the flags are meaningless, and each time we come across a function
call like the examples above, we have to search for the function definition. The
code can be made more readable by using descriptive string values, instead of booleans.

    ```php
    // Correct.
    function eat( $what, $speed = 'slowly' ) {
    ...
    }
    eat( 'mushrooms' );
    eat( 'mushrooms', 'slowly' );
    eat( 'dogfood', 'quickly' );
    ```

When more words are needed to describe the function parameters, an `$args` array
may be a better pattern.

    ```php
    function eat( $what, $args ) {
    ...
    }
    eat ( 'noodles', array( 'speed' => 'moderate' ) );
    ```

Be careful when using this pattern, as it can lead to “Undefined array index” notices
if input isn’t validated before use. Use this pattern only where it makes sense (
i.e. multiple possible arguments), not just for the sake of it.

### 󠀁[Clever Code](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#clever-code)󠁿

In general, readability is more important than cleverness or brevity.

    ```php
    isset( $var ) || $var = some_function();
    ```

Although the above line is clever, it takes a while to grok if you’re not familiar
with it. So, just write it like this:

    ```php
    if ( ! isset( $var ) ) {
        $var = some_function();
    }
    ```

Unless absolutely necessary, loose comparisons should not be used, as their behavior
can be misleading.

Correct:

    ```php
    if ( 0 === strpos( $text, 'WordPress' ) ) {
        echo esc_html__( 'Yay WordPress!', 'textdomain' );
    }
    ```

Incorrect:

    ```php
    if ( 0 == strpos( 'WordPress', 'foo' ) ) {
        echo esc_html__( 'Yay WordPress!', 'textdomain' );
    }
    ```

Assignments must not be placed in conditionals.

Correct:

    ```php
    $data = $wpdb->get_var( '...' );
    if ( $data ) {
        // Use $data.
    }
    ```

Incorrect:

    ```php
    if ( $data = $wpdb->get_var( '...' ) ) {
        // Use $data.
    }
    ```

In a `switch` statement, it’s okay to have multiple empty cases fall through to 
a common block. If a case contains a block, then falls through to the next block,
however, this must be explicitly commented.

    ```php
    switch ( $foo ) {
        case 'bar':                // Correct, an empty case can fall through without comment.
        case 'baz':
            echo esc_html( $foo ); // Incorrect, a case with a block must break, return, or have a comment.
        case 'cat':
            echo 'mouse';
            break;                 // Correct, a case with a break does not require a comment.
        case 'dog':
            echo 'horse';
            // no break            // Correct, a case can have a comment to explicitly mention the fall through.
        case 'fish':
            echo 'bird';
            break;
    }
    ```

The `goto` statement must never be used.

The `eval()` construct is _very dangerous_ and is impossible to secure. It must 
not be used.

The `create_function()` function internally performs an `eval()`. It was deprecated
in PHP 7.2 and removed in PHP 8.0. It must not be used.

### 󠀁[Closures (Anonymous Functions)](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#closures-anonymous-functions)󠁿

Where appropriate, closures may be used as an alternative to creating new functions
to pass as callbacks. For example:

    ```php
    $caption = preg_replace_callback(
        '/<[a-zA-Z0-9]+(?: [^<>]+>)*/',
        function ( $matches ) {
            return preg_replace( '/[\r\n\t]+/', ' ', $matches[0] );
        },
        $caption
    );
    ```

Closures should not be passed as filter or action callbacks, as removing these via`
remove_action()` / `remove_filter()` is complex (at this time) (see [#46635](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46635)
for a proposal to address this).

### 󠀁[Regular Expressions](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#regular-expressions)󠁿

Perl compatible regular expressions ([PCRE](https://www.php.net/pcre), `preg_` functions)
should be used.
 Never use the `/e` switch, use `preg_replace_callback` instead.

It’s most convenient to use single-quoted strings for regular expressions since,
contrary to double-quoted strings, they have only two metasequences which need escaping:`\'`
and `\\`.

### 󠀁[Don’t extract()](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#dont-extract)󠁿

Per [#22400](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22400):

>  `extract()` is a terrible function that makes code harder to debug and harder
> to understand. We should discourage it’s [sic] use and remove all of our uses 
> of it.

Joseph Scott has [a good write-up of why it’s bad](https://blog.josephscott.org/2009/02/05/i-dont-like-phps-extract-function/).

### 󠀁[Shell commands](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/?output_format=md#shell-commands)󠁿

Use of the [backtick operator](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.execution.php)
is not allowed.

Use of the backtick operator is identical to [`shell_exec()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.shell-exec.php),
and most hosts disable this function in the `php.ini` file for security reasons.

JavaScript has become a critical component in developing WordPress-based applications(
themes and plugins) as well as WordPress core. Standards are needed for formatting
and styling JavaScript code to maintain the same code consistency as the WordPress
standards provide for core PHP, HTML, and CSS code.

>  All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter
> how many people contributed. – [Principles of Writing Consistent, Idiomatic JavaScript](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js/)

The WordPress JavaScript Coding Standards are adapted from the [jQuery JavaScript Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js).
Our standard differs from the jQuery guidelines in the following ways:

 * WordPress uses single quotation marks for string declarations.
 * Case statements are indented within switch blocks.
 * Function contents are consistently indented, including full-file closure wrappers.
 * Some whitespace rules differ, for consistency with the WordPress PHP coding standards.
 * jQuery’s 100-character hard line limit is encouraged, but not strictly enforced.

Many of the examples below have been adapted directly from the jQuery style guide;
these differences have all been integrated into the examples on this page. Any of
the below standards and examples should be considered best practice for WordPress
code, unless explicitly noted as anti-patterns.

## 󠀁[Code Refactoring](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#code-refactoring)󠁿

>  “[Code refactoring should not be done just because we can.](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2011/03/23/code-refactoring/)”–
> Lead Developer Andrew Nacin

Many parts of the WordPress code structure for JavaScript are inconsistent in their
style. WordPress is working to gradually improve this, so the code will be clean
and easy to read at a glance.

While the coding standards are important, refactoring older .js files simply to 
conform to the standards is not an urgent issue. “Whitespace-only” patches for older
files are strongly discouraged.

All new or updated JavaScript code will be reviewed to ensure it conforms to the
standards, and passes JSHint.

## 󠀁[Spacing](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#spacing)󠁿

Use spaces liberally throughout your code. “When in doubt, space it out.”

These rules encourage liberal spacing for improved developer readability. The minification
process creates a file that is optimized for browsers to read and process.

 * Indentation with tabs.
 * No whitespace at the end of line or on blank lines.
 * Lines should usually be no longer than 80 characters, and should not exceed 100(
   counting tabs as 4 spaces). _This is a “soft” rule, but long lines generally 
   indicate unreadable or disorganized code._
 * `if`/`else`/`for`/`while`/`try` blocks should always use braces, and always go
   on multiple lines.
 * Unary special-character operators (e.g., `++`, `--`) must not have space next
   to their operand.
 * Any `,` and `;` must not have preceding space.
 * Any `;` used as a statement terminator must be at the end of the line.
 * Any `:` after a property name in an object definition must not have preceding
   space.
 * The `?` and `:` in a ternary conditional must have space on both sides.
 * No filler spaces in empty constructs (e.g., `{}`, `[]`, `fn()`).
 * There should be a new line at the end of each file.
 * Any `!` negation operator should have a following space.^(*)
 * All function bodies are indented by one tab, even if the entire file is wrapped
   in a closure.^(*)
 * Spaces may align code within documentation blocks or within a line, but only 
   tabs should be used at the start of a line.^(*)

: The WordPress JavaScript standards prefer slightly broader whitespace rules than
the jQuery style guide. These deviations are for consistency between the PHP and
JavaScript files in the WordPress codebase.

Whitespace can easily accumulate at the end of a line – avoid this, as trailing 
whitespace is caught as an error in JSHint. One way to catch whitespace buildup 
is enabling visible whitespace characters within your text editor.

### 󠀁[Object Declarations](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#object-declarations)󠁿

Object declarations can be made on a single line if they are short (remember the
line length guidelines). When an object declaration is too long to fit on one line,
there must be one property per line and each line ended by a comma. Property names
only need to be quoted if they are reserved words or contain special characters:

Arrays can be declared on a single line if they are short (remember the line length
guidelines). When an array is too long to fit on one line, each member must be placed
on its own line and each line ended by a comma.

    ```javascript
    // Preferred
    var obj = {
        ready: 9,
        when: 4,
        'you are': 15,
    };
    var arr = [
        9,
        4,
        15,
    ];

    // Acceptable for small objects and arrays
    var obj = { ready: 9, when: 4, 'you are': 15 };
    var arr = [ 9, 4, 15 ];

    // Bad
    var obj = { ready: 9,
        when: 4, 'you are': 15 };
    var arr = [ 9,
        4, 15 ];
    ```

### 󠀁[Arrays and Function Calls](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#arrays-and-function-calls)󠁿

Always include extra spaces around elements and arguments:

    ```javascript
    array = [ a, b ];

    foo( arg );

    foo( 'string', object );

    foo( options, object[ property ] );

    foo( node, 'property', 2 );

    prop = object[ 'default' ];

    firstArrayElement = arr[ 0 ];
    ```

### 󠀁[Examples of Good Spacing](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#examples-of-good-spacing)󠁿

    ```javascript
    var i;

    if ( condition ) {
        doSomething( 'with a string' );
    } else if ( otherCondition ) {
        otherThing( {
            key: value,
            otherKey: otherValue
        } );
    } else {
        somethingElse( true );
    }

    // Unlike jQuery, WordPress prefers a space after the ! negation operator.
    // This is also done to conform to our PHP standards.
    while ( ! condition ) {
        iterating++;
    }

    for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
        object[ array[ i ] ] = someFn( i );
        $( '.container' ).val( array[ i ] );
    }

    try {
        // Expressions
    } catch ( e ) {
        // Expressions
    }
    ```

## 󠀁[Semicolons](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#semicolons)󠁿

Use them. Never rely on Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI).

## 󠀁[Indentation and Line Breaks](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#indentation-and-line-breaks)󠁿

Indentation and line breaks add readability to complex statements.

Tabs should be used for indentation. Even if the entire file is contained in a closure(
i.e., an immediately invoked function), the contents of that function should be 
indented by one tab:

    ```javascript
    ( function ( $ ) {
        // Expressions indented

        function doSomething() {
            // Expressions indented
        }
    } )( jQuery );
    ```

### 󠀁[Blocks and Curly Braces](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#blocks-and-curly-braces)󠁿

`if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `try` blocks should always use braces, and always
go on multiple lines. The opening brace should be on the same line as the function
definition, the conditional, or the loop. The closing brace should be on the line
directly following the last statement of the block.

    ```javascript
    var a, b, c;

    if ( myFunction() ) {
        // Expressions
    } else if ( ( a && b ) || c ) {
        // Expressions
    } else {
        // Expressions
    }
    ```

### 󠀁[Multi-line Statements](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#multi-line-statements)󠁿

When a statement is too long to fit on one line, line breaks must occur after an
operator.

    ```javascript
    // Bad
    var html = '<p>The sum of ' + a + ' and ' + b + ' plus ' + c
        + ' is ' + ( a + b + c ) + '</p>';

    // Good
    var html = '<p>The sum of ' + a + ' and ' + b + ' plus ' + c +
        ' is ' + ( a + b + c ) + '</p>';
    ```

Lines should be broken into logical groups if it improves readability, such as splitting
each expression of a ternary operator onto its own line, even if both will fit on
a single line.

    ```javascript
    // Acceptable
    var baz = ( true === conditionalStatement() ) ? 'thing 1' : 'thing 2';

    // Better
    var baz = firstCondition( foo ) && secondCondition( bar ) ?
        qux( foo, bar ) :
        foo;
    ```

When a conditional is too long to fit on one line, each operand of a logical operator
in the boolean expression must appear on its own line, indented one extra level 
from the opening and closing parentheses.

    ```javascript
    if (
        firstCondition() &&
        secondCondition() &&
        thirdCondition()
    ) {
        doStuff();
    }
    ```

### 󠀁[Chained Method Calls](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#chained-method-calls)󠁿

When a chain of method calls is too long to fit on one line, there must be one call
per line, with the first call on a separate line from the object the methods are
called on. If the method changes the context, an extra level of indentation must
be used.

    ```javascript
    elements
        .addClass( 'foo' )
        .children()
            .html( 'hello' )
        .end()
        .appendTo( 'body' );
    ```

## 󠀁[Assignments and Globals](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#assignments-and-globals)󠁿

### 󠀁[Declaring Variables with const and let](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#declaring-variables-with-const-and-let)󠁿

For code written using ES2015 or newer, `const` and `let` should always be used 
in place of `var`. A declaration should use `const` unless its value will be reassigned,
in which case `let` is appropriate.

Unlike `var`, it is not necessary to declare all variables at the top of a function.
Instead, they are to be declared at the point at which they are first used.

### 󠀁[Declaring Variables With var](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#declaring-variables-with-var)󠁿

Each function should begin with a single comma-delimited `var` statement that declares
any local variables necessary. If a function does not declare a variable using `
var`, that variable can leak into an outer scope (which is frequently the global
scope, a worst-case scenario), and can unwittingly refer to and modify that data.

Assignments within the `var` statement should be listed on individual lines, while
declarations can be grouped on a single line. Any additional lines should be indented
with an additional tab. Objects and functions that occupy more than a handful of
lines should be assigned outside of the `var` statement, to avoid over-indentation.

    ```javascript
    // Good
    var k, m, length,
        // Indent subsequent lines by one tab
        value = 'WordPress';

    // Bad
    var foo = true;
    var bar = false;
    var a;
    var b;
    var c;
    ```

### 󠀁[Globals](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#globals)󠁿

In the past, WordPress core made heavier use of global variables. Since core JavaScript
files are sometimes used within plugins, existing globals should not be removed.

All globals used within a file should be documented at the top of that file. Multiple
globals can be comma-separated.

This example would make `passwordStrength` an allowed global variable within that
file:

    ```javascript
    /* global passwordStrength:true */
    ```

The “true” after `passwordStrength` means that this global is being defined within
this file. If you are accessing a global which is defined elsewhere, omit `:true`
to designate the global as read-only.

### 󠀁[Common Libraries](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#common-libraries)󠁿

Backbone, jQuery, Underscore, and the global `wp` object are all registered as allowed
globals in the root `.jshintrc` file.

Backbone and Underscore may be accessed directly at any time. jQuery should be accessed
through `$` by passing the `jQuery` object into an anonymous function:

    ```javascript
    ( function ( $ ) {
        // Expressions
    } )( jQuery );
    ```

This will negate the need to call `.noConflict()`, or to set `$` using another variable.

Files which add to, or modify, the `wp` object must safely access the global to 
avoid overwriting previously set properties:

    ```javascript
    // At the top of the file, set "wp" to its existing value (if present)
    window.wp = window.wp || {};
    ```

## 󠀁[Naming Conventions](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#naming-conventions)󠁿

Variable and function names should be full words, using camel case with a lowercase
first letter. This is an area where this standard differs from the [WordPress PHP coding standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/#naming-conventions).

Names should be descriptive, but not excessively so. Exceptions are allowed for 
iterators, such as the use of `i` to represent the index in a loop.

### 󠀁[Abbreviations and Acronyms](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#abbreviations-and-acronyms)󠁿

[Acronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym) must be written with each of its
composing letters capitalized. This is intended to reflect that each letter of the
acronym is a proper word in its expanded form.

All other [abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation) must be written
as camel case, with an initial capitalized letter followed by lowercase letters.

If an abbreviation or an acronym occurs at the start of a variable name, it must
be written to respect the camelcase naming rules covering the first letter of a 
variable or class definition. For variable assignment, this means writing the abbreviation
entirely as lowercase. For class definitions, its initial letter should be capitalized.

    ```javascript
    // "Id" is an abbreviation of "Identifier":
    const userId = 1;

    // "DOM" is an acronym of "Document Object Model":
    const currentDOMDocument = window.document;

    // Acronyms and abbreviations at the start of a variable name are consistent
    // with camelcase rules covering the first letter of a variable or class.
    const domDocument = window.document;
    class DOMDocument {}
    class IdCollection {}
    ```

### 󠀁[Class Definitions](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#class-definitions)󠁿

Constructors intended for use with `new` should have a capital first letter (UpperCamelCase).

A [`class` definition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
must use the UpperCamelCase convention, regardless of whether it is intended to 
be used with `new` construction.

    ```javascript
    class Earth {
        static addHuman( human ) {
            Earth.humans.push( human );
        }

        static getHumans() {
            return Earth.humans;
        }
    }

    Earth.humans = [];
    ```

All [`@wordpress/element`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/element) Components,
including stateless function components, should be named using Class Definition 
naming rules, both for consistency and to reflect the fact that a component may 
need to be transitioned from a function to a class without breaking compatibility.

### 󠀁[Constants](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#constants)󠁿

An exception to camel case is made for constant values which are never intended 
to be reassigned or mutated. Such variables must use the [SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case#History).

In almost all cases, a constant should be defined in the top-most scope of a file.
It is important to note that [JavaScript’s `const` assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const)
is conceptually more limited than what is implied here, where a value assigned by`
const` in JavaScript can in-fact be mutated, and is only protected against reassignment.
A constant as defined in these coding guidelines applies only to values which are
expected to never change, and is a strategy for developers to communicate intent,
more than it is a technical restriction.

## 󠀁[Comments](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#comments)󠁿

Comments come before the code to which they refer, and should always be preceded
by a blank line. Capitalize the first letter of the comment, and include a period
at the end when writing full sentences. There must be a single space between the
comment token (`//`) and the comment text.

    ```javascript
    someStatement();

    // Explanation of something complex on the next line
    $( 'p' ).doSomething();

    // This is a comment that is long enough to warrant being stretched
    // over the span of multiple lines.
    ```

JSDoc comments should use the `/**` multi-line comment opening. Refer to the [JavaScript Documentation Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/javascript/#multi-line-comments)
for more information.

Inline comments are allowed as an exception when used to annotate special arguments
in formal parameter lists:

    ```javascript
    function foo( types, selector, data, fn, /* INTERNAL */ one ) {
        // Do stuff
    }
    ```

## 󠀁[Equality](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#equality)󠁿

Strict equality checks (`===`) must be used in favor of abstract equality checks(`
==`).

## 󠀁[Type Checks](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#type-checks)󠁿

These are the preferred ways of checking the type of an object:

 * String: `typeof object === 'string'`
 * Number: `typeof object === 'number'`
 * Boolean: `typeof object === 'boolean'`
 * Object: `typeof object === 'object'` or `_.isObject( object )`
 * Plain Object: `jQuery.isPlainObject( object )`
 * Function: `_.isFunction( object )` or `jQuery.isFunction( object )`
 * Array: `_.isArray( object )` or `jQuery.isArray( object )`
 * Element: `object.nodeType` or `_.isElement( object )`
 * null: `object === null`
 * null or undefined: `object == null`
 * undefined:
    - Global Variables: `typeof variable === 'undefined'`
    - Local Variables: `variable === undefined`
    - Properties: `object.prop === undefined`
    - Any of the above: `_.isUndefined( object )`

Anywhere Backbone or Underscore are already used, you are encouraged to use [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/#isElement)‘
s type checking methods over jQuery’s.

## 󠀁[Strings](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#strings)󠁿

Use single-quotes for string literals:

    ```javascript
    var myStr = 'strings should be contained in single quotes';
    ```

When a string contains single quotes, they need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`):

    ```javascript
    // Escape single quotes within strings:
    'Note the backslash before the \'single quotes\'';
    ```

## 󠀁[Switch Statements](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#switch-statements)󠁿

The usage of `switch` statements is generally discouraged, but can be useful when
there are a large number of cases – especially when multiple cases can be handled
by the same block, or fall-through logic (the `default` case) can be leveraged.

When using `switch` statements:

 * Use a `break` for each case other than `default`. When allowing statements to“
   fall through,” note that explicitly.
 * Indent `case` statements one tab within the `switch`.

    ```javascript
    switch ( event.keyCode ) {
        // ENTER and SPACE both trigger x()
        case $.ui.keyCode.ENTER:
        case $.ui.keyCode.SPACE:
            x();
            break;
        case $.ui.keyCode.ESCAPE:
            y();
            break;
        default:
            z();
    }
    ```

It is not recommended to return a value from within a switch statement: use the `
case` blocks to set values, then `return` those values at the end.

    ```javascript
    function getKeyCode( keyCode ) {
        var result;

        switch ( event.keyCode ) {
            case $.ui.keyCode.ENTER:
            case $.ui.keyCode.SPACE:
                result = 'commit';
                break;
            case $.ui.keyCode.ESCAPE:
                result = 'exit';
                break;
            default:
                result = 'default';
        }

        return result;
    }
    ```

## 󠀁[Best Practices](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#best-practices)󠁿

### 󠀁[Arrays](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#arrays)󠁿

Creating arrays in JavaScript should be done using the shorthand `[]` constructor
rather than the `new Array()` notation.

    ```javascript
    var myArray = [];
    ```

You can initialize an array during construction:

    ```javascript
    var myArray = [ 1, 'WordPress', 2, 'Blog' ];
    ```

In JavaScript, associative arrays are defined as objects.

### 󠀁[Objects](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#objects)󠁿

There are many ways to create objects in JavaScript. Object literal notation, `{}`,
is both the most performant, and also the easiest to read.

    ```javascript
    var myObj = {};
    ```

Object literal notation should be used unless the object requires a specific prototype,
in which case the object should be created by calling a constructor function with`
new`.

    ```javascript
    var myObj = new ConstructorMethod();
    ```

Object properties should be accessed via dot notation, unless the key is a variable
or a string that would not be a valid identifier:

    ```javascript
    prop = object.propertyName;
    prop = object[ variableKey ];
    prop = object['key-with-hyphens'];
    ```

### 󠀁[Iteration](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#iteration)󠁿

When iterating over a large collection using a `for` loop, it is recommended to 
store the loop’s max value as a variable rather than re-computing the maximum every
time:

    ```javascript
    // Good & Efficient
    var i, max;

    // getItemCount() gets called once
    for ( i = 0, max = getItemCount(); i < max; i++ ) {
        // Do stuff
    }

    // Bad & Potentially Inefficient:
    // getItemCount() gets called every time
    for ( i = 0; i < getItemCount(); i++ ) {
        // Do stuff
    }
    ```

### 󠀁[Underscore.js Collection Functions](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#underscore-js-collection-functions)󠁿

Learn and understand Underscore’s [collection and array methods](http://underscorejs.org/#collections).
These functions, including `_.each`, `_.map`, and `_.reduce`, allow for efficient,
readable transformations of large data sets.

Underscore also permits jQuery-style chaining with regular JavaScript objects:

    ```javascript
    var obj = {
        first: 'thing 1',
        second: 'thing 2',
        third: 'lox'
    };

    var arr = _.chain( obj )
        .keys()
        .map( function ( key ) {
            return key + ' comes ' + obj[ key ];
        } )
        // Exit the chain
        .value();

    // arr === [ 'first comes thing 1', 'second comes thing 2', 'third comes lox' ]
    ```

### 󠀁[Iterating Over jQuery Collections](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#iterating-over-jquery-collections)󠁿

The only time jQuery should be used for iteration is when iterating over a collection
of jQuery objects:

    ```javascript
    $tabs.each( function ( index, element ) {
        var $element = $( element );

        // Do stuff to $element
    } );
    ```

Never use jQuery to iterate over raw data or vanilla JavaScript objects.

## 󠀁[JSHint](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#jshint)󠁿

[JSHint](https://jshint.com) is an automated code quality tool, designed to catch
errors in your JavaScript code. JSHint is used in WordPress development to quickly
verify that a patch has not introduced any logic or syntax errors to the front-end.

### 󠀁[Installing and Running JSHint](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#installing-and-running-jshint)󠁿

JSHint is run using a tool called [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/). Both JSHint and
Grunt are programs written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). The `package.json`
configuration file that comes with the WordPress development code allows you to 
install and configure these tools.

To install Node.js, click the Install link on the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
website. The correct install file for your operating system will be downloaded. 
Follow the installation steps for your operating system to install the program.

Once Node.js is installed, open a command line window and navigate to the directory
where you [checked out a copy of the WordPress SVN repository](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-wordpress-locally/from-svn/)(
use `cd ~/directoryname`. You should be in the root directory which contains the`
package.json` file.

Next, type `npm install` into the command line window. This will download and install
all the Node packages used in WordPress development.

You should now be able to type `npm run grunt jshint` to have Grunt check all the
WordPress JavaScript files for syntax and logic errors. To only check core code,
type `npm run grunt jshint:core`; to only check unit test .js files, type `npm run
grunt jshint:tests`.

### 󠀁[JSHint Settings](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#jshint-settings)󠁿

The configuration options used for JSHint are stored within a [`.jshintrc`](https://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/.jshintrc)
in the WordPress SVN repository. This file defines which errors JSHint should flag
if it finds them within the WordPress source code.

### 󠀁[Target A Single File](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#target-a-single-file)󠁿

To specify a single file for JSHint to check, add `--file=filename.js` to the end
of the command. For example, this will only check the file named “admin-bar.js” 
within WordPress’s core JavaScript files:

`npm run grunt jshint:core --file=admin-bar.js`

And this would only check the “password-strength-meter.js” file within the unit 
tests directory:

`npm run grunt jshint:tests --file=password-strength-meter.js`

Limiting JSHint to a single file can be useful if you are only working on one or
two specific files and don’t want to wait for JSHint to process every single file
each time it runs.

### 󠀁[JSHint Overrides: Ignore Blocks](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/?output_format=md#jshint-overrides-ignore-blocks)󠁿

In some situations, parts of a file should be excluded from JSHint. As an example,
the script file for the admin bar contains the minified code for the jQuery HoverIntent
plugin – this is third-party code that should not pass through JSHint, even though
it is part of a WordPress core JavaScript file.

To exclude a specific file region from being processed by JSHint, enclose it in 
JSHint directive comments:

    ```javascript
    /* jshint ignore:start */
    if ( typeof jQuery.fn.hoverIntent === 'undefined' ) {
        // hoverIntent r6 - Copy of wp-includes/js/hoverIntent.min.js
        (function(a){a.fn.hoverIntent=...............
    }
    /* jshint ignore:end */
    ```

This command runs on the `before_wp_load` hook, just before the WP load process 
begins. Downloads and extracts WordPress core files to the specified path. Uses 
current directory when no path is specified. Downloaded build is verified to have
the correct md5 and then cached to the local filesystem. Subsequent uses of command
will use the local cache if it still exists.

### 󠀁[Options](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/core/download/?output_format=md#options)󠁿

 See the [argument syntax](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/references/argument-syntax/)
reference for a detailed explanation of the syntax conventions used.  [<download-
url>] Download directly from a provided URL instead of fetching the URL from the
wordpress.org servers. [--path=<path>] Specify the path in which to install WordPress.
Defaults to current directory. [--locale=<locale>] Select which language you want
to download. [--version=<version>] Select which version you want to download. Accepts
a version number, ‘latest’ or ‘nightly’. [--skip-content] Download WP without the
default themes and plugins. [--force] Overwrites existing files, if present. [--
insecure] Retry download without certificate validation if TLS handshake fails. 
Note: This makes the request vulnerable to a MITM attack. [--extract] Whether to
extract the downloaded file. Defaults to true.

### 󠀁[Examples](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/core/download/?output_format=md#examples)󠁿

    ```
    $ wp core download --locale=nl_NL
    Downloading WordPress 4.5.2 (nl_NL)...
    md5 hash verified: c5366d05b521831dd0b29dfc386e56a5
